										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Lowell Russell Concrete | Lakeville, MN Concrete Driveways, Concrete Countertops, and More!</h2>
<p>Ground frost, inclement weather, and wear and tear can take its toll on concrete causing sinking, cracking, unevenness and other <strong>concrete problems</strong>. If you are experiencing any of these problems with your driveway, sidewalk, patio, or pool area, it may be time to contact the team at <strong>Lowell Russell Concrete </strong>for concrete solutions including <strong>concrete countertops</strong> and <strong>concrete driveways</strong> in Lakeville, MN.</p>
<p>The ground frost this past winter went exceptionally deep. Coupled with wear and tear, ground frost can wreak havoc on concrete streets as well as in and around our homes. It is typically best to repair cracks, sinking, and the effects of wear and tear sooner rather than later, as it may become quite expensive if repairs are not completed in a timely manner. The tough winter and spring seasons can play a huge role in concrete problems as well as your budget. High traffic concrete typically takes a lot of punishment. Proper repairs can save you from future damage as well as ensure the safety of those walking on patios and sidewalks. If you notice that cracking is a recurring problem, it may be best to call in the professionals to find the contributing factors instead of doing just cosmetic repair.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to repair interior or<strong> exterior concrete</strong>. Determining the appropriate types of materials to make proper repairs is crucial to ensure future durability. When you have a strong and well repaired floor, driveway, or sidewalk, it increases the value of your property, and ensures the safety of your family, friends, workers, or all who may enter.</p>
<p>If you have interior or <strong>exterior concrete</strong> that is cracking or sinking, breakage, potholes, or other concrete problems or worries, please give us a call. Our professional staff can address your concerns and provide the expert workmanship and quality products to correct problems or completely replace failing concrete. We’ve all been waiting for spring, and now that it is here and Mother Nature’s winter has taken its toll, get your <strong>concrete repaired</strong> for safety and increase the value of your home today. Then you can enjoy the lazy days of summer by the pool area with friends and family. Now that’s living! <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopatios.php">Contact Lowell Russell Concrete today</a>!</p>

<p align="left">There’s a definite chill in the air these days. Temperatures are dropping and the first few flakes of snow have fallen from the sky. Winter’s impending arrival gives homeowners new concerns. One of those concerns is keeping your concrete driveway and pathways ice-free and safe for family members, friends and neighborhood dog walkers.</p>
<h3 align="left"><a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/mn-concrete-stain-lowell-russell.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignright  wp-image-340" alt="mn concrete stain lowell russell" src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/mn-concrete-stain-lowell-russell.jpg" width="319" height="205" /></a></h3>
<p align="left">To help keep pathways and <strong>concrete driveways</strong> safe, homeowners have several choices when it comes to products that de-ice concrete surfaces. Lowell Russell, the owner of <strong>Lowell Russell Concrete</strong> in Lakeville, MN, encourages homeowners to consider using sand on their concrete surfaces because it’s readily available and environmentally friendly.</p>
<p align="left">If homeowners prefer to use a deicing agent, there are several types available. Here’s a quick summary of some types of deicing compounds consumers can consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular rock salt (sodium chloride) can melt show and ice until temperatures drop to between 16 and 20 degrees Fahrenheit. This product has been known to pollute streams, rivers and lakes.</li>
<li>Calcium chloride comes in small, rounded white pellets and can melt snow and ice until temperatures fall below zero. Please note this de-icer can cause skin irritation if your hands are moist when using it.</li>
<li>Potassium chloride only melts ice when the temperature is above 15 degrees, but when combined with other chemicals, it can melt ice at lower temperatures. This product by itself  does not irritate skin and does not harm vegetation.</li>
<li>Magnesium chloride continues to melt snow and ice until the temperature drops to 13 degrees below zero. It is less toxic to plants, trees and shrubs than other deicing products.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="left">This month’s dramatically falling temperatures and heavy freezes won’t damage <strong>concrete patios</strong> and driveways if the concrete was installed correctly. Unfortunately, too many homeowners will find themselves faced with <strong>cracked concrete</strong> next spring.</p>
<p align="left">“Most concrete is not done properly,” says Lowell Russell, the owner of <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a> in Lakeville, MN. While some types of cold-weather damage can be repaired, depending on the condition of the concrete, “in extreme cases, it will need to be replaced.”</p>
<p align="left">&#8220;Concrete that looks just as good after a Minnesota winter as it did before has several characteristics, including proper control joints, proper reinforcing and a proper Class 5 (gravel) base&#8221; explains Russell.</p>
<p align="left">Proper control joints will prevent damage to the concrete from frost heaving, the result of pressure created from a combination of freezing temperatures and soil defrosting. Frost heaving is the main cause of cold-weather damage to concrete patios, pathways, driveways and other surfaces. “If the proper control joints were used when the concrete was installed, the concrete will settle back in its original position once the frost goes out” says Russell.</p>
<p align="left">Curing is another of the most important steps in concrete construction, and when it’s done properly, the concrete’s strength and durability are greatly increased. Curing concrete is the term used for stopping freshly poured concrete from drying out too quickly.</p>
<p align="left">Concrete hardens as a result of hydration, the chemical reaction between cement and water. However, hydration occurs only if water is available and if the concrete’s temperature stays within a suitable range. During the curing period, usually from five to seven days after placement for conventional concrete, the surface needs to be kept moist to permit the hydration process.</p>
<p align="left">“Concrete must be properly cured before a deep freeze” says Russell. Once the temperature drops below 60 degrees, the professionals at Lowell Russell Concrete place frost blankets on newly poured concrete to ensure proper curing. And that’s just one of the many important steps they take to make sure that you’re completely satisfied with your new concrete surface.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Is it time to reseal your stained concrete? Here are some tips.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Minnessota Concrete, Stained Concrete Maintenance Tips</h2>
<p>You&#8217;ve been enjoying the beautiful <strong>stained concrete</strong> of your backyard patio or pool area for several years. After all, it’s the perfect place for you to enjoy your morning coffee, unwind after a long day, or throw a cookout and entertain friends on weekends. But, perhaps lately you&#8217;ve been noticing that it has lost some of its sheen and that water doesn&#8217;t bead up on the surface like it used to. If that’s the case, this is a great time to consider <strong>concrete resealing</strong> for your stained concrete.<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-325" alt="minnestota concrete blog, stained concrete, lowell russell concrete" src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/stained-concrete-edit-e1380037751863.jpg" width="267" height="291" /></p>
<p>Properly sealed stained concrete will help protect your investment and withstand extremes in weather and temperature much better than concrete that hasn&#8217;t been resealed in a long time. Benefits of resealing include protection from fading caused by UV rays, an improved appearance, plus protection from stains, moisture, deicing salts and other chemicals.</p>
<p>Industry experts generally recommend that resealing should be done every two or three years or as needed. Stained concrete that’s exposed to full sunlight on a consistent basis will need to be resealed more often than those surfaces that are shaded all or part of the time. Once you&#8217;ve made the decision to reseal your stained concrete, you have two choices: Should you hire a concrete company to perform the task, or should you tackle the project yourself?</p>
<p>Although resealing your stained concrete may appear to be an easy DIY task, there are a number of maintenance issues you should review before simply applying a sealant sold at a big box store. Are there any cracks in the concrete that require more than a sealant to repair? How about food or beverage stains or possible discoloration from salt applications? These will need to be carefully addressed and thoroughly cleaned away utilizing the proper cleaning chemicals and washing techniques. Is there a particular sealant that will work best for your concrete due to its exposure to sun, rain, or types of trees or plants that drop seeds or fruits that stain and blemish the concrete? Once this is all properly assessed the area is ready to receive a fresh new coat of protective sealant.</p>
<p>If you feel this is even the slightest bit beyond your DIY capabilities, please give us at <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a> a call. After all, we specialize in concrete, and caring for your existing concrete surfaces is one of our services. We will gladly inspect your concrete surface and provide you with our professional opinion and an estimate of what needs to be done to prepare the surface for sealing, the best product for your particular concrete outdoor living space, and the sealing work itself. Let the professionals at Lowell Russell Concrete help you protect your outdoor investment so you can sit back, relax, and enjoy the enhanced look and beauty of your newly resealed concrete!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While deciding which type of countertop to install in your new kitchen, you were faced with a multitude of choices, including, but not limited to, granite, wood, stainless steel, tile or concrete. You finally decided to have concrete countertops designed and installed because of their durability, beauty and the numerous options you were given for stain color and texture.</p>
<p>Now, you’re enjoying your customized concrete countertops and you want to keep them looking beautiful for years to come. After all, your new countertops aren’t just conventional countertops, they’re unique works-of-art that help draw friends and family to the warmth and comfort of your kitchen.</p>
<p>To help maintain the beauty and character of your concrete countertops, keep these simple care tips in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow the instructions you were given by your concrete contractor regarding periodic re-sealing.</li>
<li>Clean them daily with warm water and a mild non-abrasive soap on a dish cloth or sponge. Cleaning agents containing bleach, ammonia or vinegar should always be avoided.</li>
<li>Quickly wipe off spills from your countertops as soon as they occur. Keep in mind that some liquids, such as wine, grape or prune juice or oil, can stain concrete surfaces. Other types of liquid, including citrus juices, such as lemon or lime juice, and vinegar, can create light spots and etch concrete.</li>
<li>Don’t cut on your countertops. Use cutting boards when chopping and preparing foods. Cutting won’t hurt them, but it could damage the sealer, which helps keep out water and stains.</li>
<li>Avoid placing hot pots, pans or baking sheets on concrete countertops. While concrete is heat resistant, it could damage or discolor the sealer.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on caring for your concrete countertops or to add their style and functionality to your living space, contact the professionals at <a title="Lowell Russell Concrete of Minnesota" href="https://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Concrete has been around for a long time, and you can count on it being around a lot longer than you and I! Why? Because it lasts.</p>
<p>Did you know that concrete dates back as far as 3000 BC? At that time, Egyptians discovered that by combining mortar, mud and straw they were able to form a durable concrete-like substance. They used this primitive concrete to securely bind the bricks forming the pyramids that have withstood the elements of time. Likewise, the Romans used a similar substance nearly 2000 years ago to build structures of great significance, including the Coliseum and the dome of Pantheon, much of which remains intact today.</p>
<p>Although widespread use of concrete was largely abandoned for almost 13 centuries, it regained popularity in the 16th century as various engineers and inventors discovered that, with a few modifications and production techniques modern to those time periods, concrete proved to be a virtually indestructible element of construction.</p>
<p>There are several important milestones in the history of concrete that ensured its predominant place in modern structural engineering:</p>
<p>•    In 1756, a British engineer by the name of John Smeaton created a modern day version of concrete, thus establishing concrete as a preferred substance for building durable structures.<br />
•    In 1824, Portland cement, a combination of limestone and clay, was introduced by Joseph Aspdin, an English inventor, and remains the dominant cement used in concrete today.<br />
•    In 1849, Joseph Monier, a Parisian gardener, invented reinforced concrete, which enabled concrete structures to withstand even greater weight.<br />
•    In 1930, resistance to water was improved, reducing the likelihood of freeze and thaw damage.</p>
<p>Since its discovery, countless improvements and enhancements have been made in the production of concrete. Today, we owe not only the basic infrastructure of our cities and towns to concrete (buildings, canals, roadways), but the preservation of such structures to enjoy for years to come.</p>
<p>The introduction of treatments, such as staining and imprinting, has added an artistic flair to structures that ensured the finished product would not only be durable, but aesthetically pleasing to the eye, as well.</p>
<p>Build to last. Build with style. Build with concrete. And call upon Lowell Russell Concrete to design, build and create the concrete construct that fulfills you needs and requirements!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[So, go ahead and build your castle. Lowell Russell Concrete will make it stands the test of time and be there for the generations to come!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that the dome of the Roman Pantheon was built with the use of concrete in 126 AD and, despite other concrete structures new and old, holds the world record for the largest unreinforced concrete dome? If you’ve had the fortune of traveling to Italy you may have noticed how well it has held up for almost 2,000 years. Not too shabby!</p>
<p>Concrete is durable. Durability refers to the ability to last a long time without significant wear and tear. Not only does this mean that the structure itself will hold up longer, but in the long run conserves on the natural resources required every time a new structure is built. It also reduces waste that accompanies the destruction of existing structures.</p>
<p>In fact, concrete often exceeds its own building design life expectancy. Most concrete structures are destroyed not because they are falling apart, but because they are no longer needed or a totally new structure is desired. More often than not, a concrete structure can be &#8220;recycled&#8221; with interior changes or by altering the face of the building.</p>
<p>What makes concrete so durable?</p>
<p>1.     Composition: Concrete is a composite material, meaning that it is made from at least two discrete substances. Concrete is primarily composed of aggregate (coarse gravel or crushed rocks), cement and water.  As with any composite material, durability is dependent upon the proper mixture of these materials.<br />
2.    Fire resistant: Quite simply, concrete does not burn.<br />
3.    Wind resistant: Concrete has minimal horizontal movement and provides greater protection during high winds, tornadoes and hurricanes.<br />
4.    Ultraviolet resistant: Concrete is not harmed by ultraviolet rays from the sun, nor do pigments in concrete fade as quickly as paint.<br />
5.    Vermin-proof: Concrete is inedible, even for those with not so discriminating taste.  Therefore, it is not subject to vermin and insects as many other building materials are, such as wood and plaster.</p>
<p>So, go ahead and build your castle. <a title="Lowell Russell Concrete in Minnesota" href="https://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete </a>will make it stands the test of time and be there for the generations to come!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Concrete floors" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshofloors.php">Concrete floors</a> that have been stained, colored, or painted are the  newest material of choice for both homer designers and homeowners. When  these floors are installed, they are acid-stained then sealed with a  concrete sealer so that they will be water-resistant as well as  impervious to stains, dirt, and anything abrasive.</p>
<p><span id="more-199"></span>If you own a home with one of these beautiful new floors or are thinking  of having one installed, it’s good to know that care and maintenance is  easy and not very labor intensive.</p>
<p>Dusting frequently to remove dust and dirt will help safeguard against  any abrasion, which may take away from the shine. Some experts recommend  a micro-fiber mop and using overlapping and uninterrupted mopping  motions.</p>
<p>To get rid of stains and set in dirt, regular damp mopping with cool  water will help keep your concrete floor shiny. If you use a cleaner, use one  with a neutral pH balance – not too acidic and not too alkaline. Make  sure the mop is just slightly damp and not completely wet. Mops like the  Swiffer Wet-Jet are not recommended because the cleaners that come with  them contain solvents that will streak the sealer on your floor and  leave it looking hazy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Exterior and decorative concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoexterior-concrete.php">Exterior and decorative concrete</a> requires care and periodic maintenance.  The following care and maintenance plan should be performed on a  regular basis.</p>
<p><span id="more-159"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Scrub or pressure wash dirt, oil, abrasives such as sand or gravel</li>
<li>Remove leaves and fertilizers that may stain concrete</li>
<li>Never use an acid based cleaner. Apply a neutral cleaner to the surface with a scrub brush and rinse.</li>
</ul>
<p>A cement sealer should always be applied to new exterior cement  surfaces. Preparation for a sealer application requires performing the  basic routine maintenance. Depending on the intensity of sunlight,  automobile traffic and climate conditions, resealing may be necessary on  a yearly basis. Chemicals and solvents can severely damage the  protective coating of a sealed cement surface and it may require  resealing.</p>
<p>Try to avoid chemical deicers and never use rock salt or any agent that  contains ammonium nitrate or ammonium sulfate, as irreparable damage can  occur.</p>
<p>Oil stains are some of the most difficult stains to remove from  concrete. However, recently, there has been a scientific breakthrough in oil  stain removal. A single celled microorganism has been developed that  feeds on oil. After they eat all the oil, they die and the concrete  surface is clean and free of oil.</p>
<p>Following these few simple tips will help keep your exterior or <a title="decorative concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodecorative-concrete.php">decorative concrete</a> looking great and keep it lasting for many seasons to come.</p>

<p>What some don’t know is that concrete driveways can add an enhanced look  to one’s driveway with optional choices that give the appearance of  slate, stone or brick. Many designs are available for the homeowner;  designs that enhance and upgrade the look of most homes.
