<p>As spring-like weather finally begins to show its face in Southeastern Minnesota, it is time to get rid of the winter doldrums and spend time outside. One of the most gratifying ways to do this is to spend time relaxing on the patio. If grilling, entertaining, and spending time with family and friends is something you do best, a patio is the perfect choice to get the job done. Contact <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho"><strong>Lowell Russell Concrete</strong> </a>to get the long overdue project of a Lakeville, MN <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopatios.php"><strong>concrete patio</strong></a> started today.</p>
<p>Relaxation is something most of us need more of. Because of hectic schedules, family obligations, and work, relaxation often times takes the back seat. This eventually makes us tense, stressed, and unhealthy. Having a <strong>concrete patio</strong> with some comfortable chairs, a table, and other amenities provides plentiful amounts of enjoyment and delight. A time to relax, take in the sun and Mother Nature’s gifts, visit with family and friends, or read a good book—all of which decrease our stress level and make us happier and healthier.</p>
<p>Whether you choose a concrete slab, pavers, or some other design and style, a patio is sure to provide years of enjoyment, delight, and pleasure. At the end of the day, when you want a retreat from the busy-ness around you, your patio can become your sanctuary. Perhaps flower gardens or rock gardens along with a fountain mixed-in next to or within your patio can provide hours of relaxation. Stoke up a fire, start the grill, get some comfortable furniture, and invite friends or family to enjoy a festive barbeque. On a calm summers eve take in the fragrances of fresh blossoms in your beautiful, serene yard. Or simply enjoy the atmosphere with a good book and quiet time to appreciate the sounds and scents of nature around you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Lowell Russell Concrete | Providing concrete pools in Lakeville, MN and surrounding communities</h2>
<p>With nicer weather upon us and the itch to be outside after the long, harsh winter, let your mind wander to the lazy days of summer! Think scorching hot rays of the sun, an even tan, and cooling off in the swimming pool. Sounds awesome, uplifting and a real treat, right? Have you thought about installing your own pool, or do you currently have a pool that is beginning to look a little weathered and needs some attention? Now is the time to think this project through, whether you need repairs or wish to begin the planning process to build your own pool. Contact the professionals at <strong>Lowell Russell Concrete</strong> for inspiring ideas, designs, and shapes for your <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopools.php"><strong>concrete pool</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Concrete swimming pools</strong> have a great advantage when compared to other types of pools such as fiberglass or vinyl lined pools. Vinyl lined pools have been shown to be less durable, and the risk of tears, stains, and leaks is much higher when compared to concrete. <strong>Concrete pools</strong> can be customized and feature additional amenities such as waterfalls if desired. The shapes and designs are endless, depending on your wants, needs, and desires. Another enhancement for added attraction is to line the pool with tiles, thus adding a unique, eye-catching look.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you already have a pool or are thinking of installing one, proper upkeep and repair is a necessity. A pool that is properly winterized can be readied for the summer months relatively easily and will last for many, many years.</p>
<p>A backyard oasis can be yours by installing not only a pool, but a patio and serene surroundings as well. Maybe you’ve always dreamed of a spa or a pool and pool house to entertain your guests. Perhaps a grotto, a fire pit, or an outdoor kitchen is on your bucket list. All of this can be accomplished with a little creative planning!</p>
<p><a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoexterior-concrete.php">Contact the professional team at Lowell Russell Concrete today</a> to discuss and plan your <strong>concrete pool</strong>, patio, and other items to create your own backyard oasis. Like the saying says, “Relax and take in the abundance of life.” &#8211; Author Unknown.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Lowell Russell Concrete | Lakeville, MN Concrete Driveways, Concrete Countertops, and More!</h2>
<p>Ground frost, inclement weather, and wear and tear can take its toll on concrete causing sinking, cracking, unevenness and other <strong>concrete problems</strong>. If you are experiencing any of these problems with your driveway, sidewalk, patio, or pool area, it may be time to contact the team at <strong>Lowell Russell Concrete </strong>for concrete solutions including <strong>concrete countertops</strong> and <strong>concrete driveways</strong> in Lakeville, MN.</p>
<p>The ground frost this past winter went exceptionally deep. Coupled with wear and tear, ground frost can wreak havoc on concrete streets as well as in and around our homes. It is typically best to repair cracks, sinking, and the effects of wear and tear sooner rather than later, as it may become quite expensive if repairs are not completed in a timely manner. The tough winter and spring seasons can play a huge role in concrete problems as well as your budget. High traffic concrete typically takes a lot of punishment. Proper repairs can save you from future damage as well as ensure the safety of those walking on patios and sidewalks. If you notice that cracking is a recurring problem, it may be best to call in the professionals to find the contributing factors instead of doing just cosmetic repair.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to repair interior or<strong> exterior concrete</strong>. Determining the appropriate types of materials to make proper repairs is crucial to ensure future durability. When you have a strong and well repaired floor, driveway, or sidewalk, it increases the value of your property, and ensures the safety of your family, friends, workers, or all who may enter.</p>
<p>If you have interior or <strong>exterior concrete</strong> that is cracking or sinking, breakage, potholes, or other concrete problems or worries, please give us a call. Our professional staff can address your concerns and provide the expert workmanship and quality products to correct problems or completely replace failing concrete. We’ve all been waiting for spring, and now that it is here and Mother Nature’s winter has taken its toll, get your <strong>concrete repaired</strong> for safety and increase the value of your home today. Then you can enjoy the lazy days of summer by the pool area with friends and family. Now that’s living! <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopatios.php">Contact Lowell Russell Concrete today</a>!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Lowell Russell Concrete | Lakeville, MN Concrete Installation and Preservation</h2>
<p>If you look around your home, you will see that you probably have quite a bit of <strong>concrete</strong> – from sidewalks to patios to driveways. With the harsh winters in the Midwest, the ground frost has a depth of several feet, particularly this year with the sub-zero temperatures hitting us for many consecutive days. Because of this, ice can form below concrete surfaces and cause it to heave or crack. Many experts say that the bigger the crack, the bigger the problem. Frost heaving of concrete is the result of pressure created from a combination of freezing temperatures and soil defrosting and is one of the main reasons for damage to patios, sidewalks, driveways, and even streets or highways. If concrete is installed and poured properly, heaving can be avoided and your patio or sidewalk will look as perfect when spring rolls around as it did last summer before the cold and freezing temperatures were upon us. The professionals at<strong> Lowell Russell Concrete</strong> take pride in their work and will make every effort to get and keep your Lakeville, MN <strong>concrete project</strong> just the way you dreamed it would be—free of heaving or cracking and beautiful to show off to guests.</p>
<p><strong>Curing of concrete</strong> is an important aspect of keeping your <strong>concrete patio</strong> or area looking great and holding up during the harsh winters and thawing springs in the Midwest. With proper curing and hydration, the strength, durability, and look of the concrete are increased greatly. Proper and complete curing generally requires a period of 7-10 days after pouring of the concrete. Warmer weather and hydration are typically needed for concrete to cure properly and allow for a durable surface. If you have no other option than to pour concrete during a colder time of the year, frost blankets should be used to ensure proper curing.</p>
<p>There are several different types of cracks and heaving that you need to look for in keeping your concreting in top-notch condition:<br />
• Hairline cracks are quite small and typically do not threaten the structure of your <strong>concrete</strong>, but they can become a point for ground water to enter, thus making the problem worse with time.<br />
• Spalling is flaking, peeling, and erosion of the top layer of concrete and is typically caused by expansion and contraction of moisture during the freeze and thaw cycles.<br />
• Settling is a sagging or caving of the concrete. This often times results from poorly drained or poorly compacted soil, causing the ground underneath to be unstable.<br />
• Heaving as noted above is caused from the freeze and thaw cycles.</p>
<p>Because the changing weather is constantly attacking homeowners, <strong>concrete sealing</strong> plays an important role along with proper installation, upkeep and maintenance. <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Contact the trained professionals at <strong>Lowell Russell Concrete</strong></a> to help with proper installation of your <strong>concrete project</strong> to make your dreams come true. Keep this quote in mind, “Your dreams are like the cement. If you water it with actions, it becomes a hard concrete mass. But if you leave it exposed and unwatered, the air will easily blow it away!” ― Israelmore Avivor</p>

<p align="left">There’s a definite chill in the air these days. Temperatures are dropping and the first few flakes of snow have fallen from the sky. Winter’s impending arrival gives homeowners new concerns. One of those concerns is keeping your concrete driveway and pathways ice-free and safe for family members, friends and neighborhood dog walkers.</p>
<h3 align="left"><a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/mn-concrete-stain-lowell-russell.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignright  wp-image-340" alt="mn concrete stain lowell russell" src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/mn-concrete-stain-lowell-russell.jpg" width="319" height="205" /></a></h3>
<p align="left">To help keep pathways and <strong>concrete driveways</strong> safe, homeowners have several choices when it comes to products that de-ice concrete surfaces. Lowell Russell, the owner of <strong>Lowell Russell Concrete</strong> in Lakeville, MN, encourages homeowners to consider using sand on their concrete surfaces because it’s readily available and environmentally friendly.</p>
<p align="left">If homeowners prefer to use a deicing agent, there are several types available. Here’s a quick summary of some types of deicing compounds consumers can consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular rock salt (sodium chloride) can melt show and ice until temperatures drop to between 16 and 20 degrees Fahrenheit. This product has been known to pollute streams, rivers and lakes.</li>
<li>Calcium chloride comes in small, rounded white pellets and can melt snow and ice until temperatures fall below zero. Please note this de-icer can cause skin irritation if your hands are moist when using it.</li>
<li>Potassium chloride only melts ice when the temperature is above 15 degrees, but when combined with other chemicals, it can melt ice at lower temperatures. This product by itself  does not irritate skin and does not harm vegetation.</li>
<li>Magnesium chloride continues to melt snow and ice until the temperature drops to 13 degrees below zero. It is less toxic to plants, trees and shrubs than other deicing products.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With late-summer temperatures still reaching into the 80s and 90s, now is a great time to throw a backyard patio or pool party. So, give your friends and neighbors a call, fire up the grill and throw a fun, casual bash before school starts.</p>
<p>Traditional summer party fare, such as coleslaw, chips, hamburgers and hot dogs, are sure crowd pleasers, but maybe you would like to offer your guests a little something different. Here are a few fun ideas you can use for your late-summer get-together.</p>
<p><strong>Market Fresh:</strong> Utilize the bounty of fresh produce from your garden or local farmer’s market to create healthy and delicious fare. Boil or grill several ears of fresh sweet corn and serve them with melted butter. For extra flavor, add chopped parsley and minced garlic to the butter. Ask your guests to bring a fresh bowl of Pico de Gallo or salsa and they can vote on their favorites. For desert, serve chocolate-zucchini brownies and raspberry bars.</p>
<p><strong>Pizza Party:</strong> Make or buy pizza dough and fashion it into six-inch rounds. Offer several popular pizza toppings, including sauce, sausage, chicken, sweet peppers, onions, spinach, olives, and a variety of cheeses, and ask your guests to make their own pies. Cook them on the grill so you don’t have to turn on the oven and heat up your kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>More S’mores:</strong> Create a fun and inexpensive s’mores bar for your guests. To up the ante from traditional s’mores, lay out a selection of graham crackers, including traditional, cinnamon and chocolate. Add a variety of marshmallows, such as strawberry, chocolate and vanilla, and caramel and vanilla. Build a chocolate platter, using milk, dark and white chocolate, peanut butter cups and Andes mints. Treat your guests to a variety of non-traditional toppings – jam, lemon curd, fresh strawberries, banana and apple slices.</p>
<p>If these ideas sound great to you, but you don’t have a backyard patio for entertaining friends and family, contact the professionals at <a title="Concrete Professionals at Lowell Russell Concrete" href="https://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a>. They’ll design and install a <a title="Concrete Patio built by Lowell Russell Concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopatios.php">beautiful backyard patio</a> or pool area that you can enjoy for years to come.</p>

But we also offer more &#8220;traditional&#8221; services and concrete work for folks looking to build a new structure, add-on to their home, or need work performed on their current driveway, walkways or patio.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

With the harsh extremes of our Minnesota climate, simply digging a hole and laying block after block shouldn&#8217;t be the only objective when constructing a proper foundation. Soil type, drainage, and other factors require review before beginning a foundation project. If you are adding on to your home but only need a concrete slab poured and shaped to support the addition, we will gladly perform that work as well!</span></span></span></span></span></p>

We have experienced a very wet year, and many folks have had to put up with water seeping (or for some, pouring&#8230;) into their basements or low-lying structures. If that is happening to you, please give us a call. We can assess the situation and install a drain tile system that can eliminate the problem. A dry environment eliminates mold and mildew issues and creates a healthier home for you and your family.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

We offer a full line of repair services and products that can help mend those dilemmas! Give us call and we&#8217;ll be happy to inspect the problem, provide you with the information you need to get the problem fixed, and the products to keep your concrete as good as new.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the great things about owning your own home is performing the yearly maintenance required to keep things safe and in good repair. Great things right? Let&#8217;s be honest, some of those maintenance tasks are just plain boring and dirty chores you&#8217;d rather put-off until next year. Regardless of how hard you try, and the amount of money you throw at a problem, it remains a constant and seemingly pointless struggle. Driveways are a good example. Perhaps you&#8217;ve been tolerating a gravel driveway for years and have grown tired of mowing the stones tossed into the yard by your snow blower. Or, the asphalt paving strewn with waves and hollows requires a tanker of sealant every year to fill the ever widening cracks and glue the broken chunks back together. If this is your struggle, now is the time for a change!</p>
<p>Your driveway is probably at the top of the list when it comes to making a good impression on family and friends. It is either a welcoming, even, and sturdy pathway or a jumbled heap of stone or asphalt that has guests contemplating whether risking a broken ankle is worth the visit. A concrete driveway is extremely durable and provides many years of extremely low maintenance usage to your home. Lowell Russell Concrete can take your new driveway project from start to finish and provide an exceptional product for your dollar. Plus, with our concrete stamping, stenciling, and staining, we can create a huge variety of extraordinary and unique designs that will add distinctive personality to your home environment.</p>
<p>Please visit the <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshogallery/exterior_2.php">Lowell Russell photo gallery</a> to view examples of our previous projects, or experiment with our design tutorial to see what you can create. From simple to simply fabulous, give us a call and let us help create and install a durable driveway that provides outstanding curb appeal and exceptional function you will be proud to own for many years to come!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we reach the middle of summer many folks begin to ask themselves two questions: Why don&#8217;t we have a swimming pool, and when is the best time to have one put in? Question one is basically answered by understanding what you would like for a pool, what you can afford, and how a pool will fit in with the way your yard is currently arranged. A pool doesn&#8217;t have to simply be a hole dug in the ground with concrete poured to create a basin to hold water. At Lowell Russell Concrete we offer a multitude of design options that can make even the simplest pool a welcoming oasis of summer delight. By using our concrete stamping technology along with stains and colors we can create an aquatic environment that is beautiful, functional, and coexists properly with your outdoor environment.</p>
<p>When is the best time to have a pool put in? How about right now! Granted, this past spring was more conducive to installing an ice rink or bobsled track, but now we are bathed in the full glory of summer! There&#8217;s plenty of time left in the season to have a pool installed and take advantage of the cool and refreshing recreation a pool can provide. Visit our photo gallery to view some examples of what Lowell Russell Concrete can do for you, of feel free to give us a call and talk with one of our professionals to set-up a time to meet with you and discuss what you would like and the services we can supply.</p>
<p>We can design, install and customize your pool and surrounding areas to fit your needs and desires. A concrete pool from <a href="https://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a> will look spectacular and provide you every modern convenience, plus, being constructed of concrete, provide exceptional value and durability for many years to come.
