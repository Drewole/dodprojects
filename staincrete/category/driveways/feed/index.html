										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Stamped Concrete Driveways and Patios in Minnesota from Lowell Russell Concrete</h2>
<p>Many people enjoy the designs that can be made with bricks and traditional concrete in driveways, patios, and walkways. Unfortunately, these traditional options can leave room for weeds to pop up and spread, ruining designs like an unsightly blemish on your face. Before you accept that there’s no other option, consider a <a title="Minnesota Stamped Concrete Driveways" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php">stamped concrete driveway or patio</a> in Lakeville, MN from <a title="Home Page" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete.</a></p>
<p>With <strong>stamped concrete</strong>, you have many different options. From the design of the main layout, to choosing the border, to picking the perfect color combinations, the personalization options are endless. <strong>Stamped concrete</strong> offers a more defined pattern that sits deeper.</p>
<p>You might be thinking that a paved driveway or patio is a simpler solution for your needs, but you may be forgetting one key factor: frost.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Lowell Russell Concrete | Lakeville, MN Concrete Driveways, Concrete Countertops, and More!</h2>
<p>Ground frost, inclement weather, and wear and tear can take its toll on concrete causing sinking, cracking, unevenness and other <strong>concrete problems</strong>. If you are experiencing any of these problems with your driveway, sidewalk, patio, or pool area, it may be time to contact the team at <strong>Lowell Russell Concrete </strong>for concrete solutions including <strong>concrete countertops</strong> and <strong>concrete driveways</strong> in Lakeville, MN.</p>
<p>The ground frost this past winter went exceptionally deep. Coupled with wear and tear, ground frost can wreak havoc on concrete streets as well as in and around our homes. It is typically best to repair cracks, sinking, and the effects of wear and tear sooner rather than later, as it may become quite expensive if repairs are not completed in a timely manner. The tough winter and spring seasons can play a huge role in concrete problems as well as your budget. High traffic concrete typically takes a lot of punishment. Proper repairs can save you from future damage as well as ensure the safety of those walking on patios and sidewalks. If you notice that cracking is a recurring problem, it may be best to call in the professionals to find the contributing factors instead of doing just cosmetic repair.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to repair interior or<strong> exterior concrete</strong>. Determining the appropriate types of materials to make proper repairs is crucial to ensure future durability. When you have a strong and well repaired floor, driveway, or sidewalk, it increases the value of your property, and ensures the safety of your family, friends, workers, or all who may enter.</p>
<p>If you have interior or <strong>exterior concrete</strong> that is cracking or sinking, breakage, potholes, or other concrete problems or worries, please give us a call. Our professional staff can address your concerns and provide the expert workmanship and quality products to correct problems or completely replace failing concrete. We’ve all been waiting for spring, and now that it is here and Mother Nature’s winter has taken its toll, get your <strong>concrete repaired</strong> for safety and increase the value of your home today. Then you can enjoy the lazy days of summer by the pool area with friends and family. Now that’s living! <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopatios.php">Contact Lowell Russell Concrete today</a>!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Lowell Russell Concrete in Minnesota provides tips</h2>
<h2>for adding decorative concrete to beautify your home</h2>
<p>Who says a <strong>concrete driveway</strong> needs to be the same old plain, boring utilitarian slab of concrete almost every house in the neighborhood displays from garage to street? Minnesota concrete company, <strong><a title="MN ConcreteCompany, Lowell Russell Concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho" target="_blank">Lowell Russell Concrete</a></strong>, offers  <strong><a title="MN Decorative Concrete, Concrete Driveway" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoexterior-concrete.php" target="_blank">decorative concrete</a> </strong>advice on  how to create a unique design that will increase your home’s curb appeal while also being functional and long lasting!</p>
<p>There are many types of options available to create a <a title="MN Concrete Driveways | Lowell Russell Concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodriveways.php" target="_blank"><strong>concrete driveway</strong></a> that fits the style of your home. Perhaps a driveway the offers the look of multicolored and textured <strong>concrete pavers</strong> will give your home the perfect look. Complete your home’s unique appearance by continuing the concrete paver theme on the walkway and steps leading to your front door. With a wide range of colors and patterns to select from, you will certainly find an artistic theme that is not only highly functional and tough, but provides a warm and welcoming entryway from the street to your home!</p>
<p><a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/MN-concrete-companies-lowell-russell-concrete2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-352" alt="MN concrete companies lowell russell concrete2" src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/MN-concrete-companies-lowell-russell-concrete2.jpg" width="320" height="240" /></a>Properly preparing for your new concrete driveway is an important factor. Slope, drainage, lighting and surface are important details that need to be considered. While wanting the visual appeal, it is also important to look for features such as traction and a non-slippery material to prevent slick, hazardous steps and walkways, especially with hillside or sloped driveways. As is often seen with the Midwest winters, slippery, ice-covered walkways or stairways can be dangerous for family, friends, and visitors.</p>
<p>Another type of paving material that is becoming increasingly common is pervious concrete, as its benefits are many. Pervious concrete is an easy to clean material that prevents areas of potentially hazardous pooling of water, a problem in both summer and winter, making the drive or walkway much safer during every season. It can be used for sidewalks, patios, driveways and many other areas around your business or home.</p>
<p>Another solution for keeping your walkway, driveway, or stairway clear of ice and snow may be a snow melting system. There are several options available such as mats or cables that are perfect for both residential and commercial properties. With these options, you will have the peace of mind that comes with knowing you will have a safe walkway, driveway, and entry to your home. Instead of salting, which can be hard on the concrete surface, or chipping and shoveling ice and packed snow, you will have time to enjoy the things that matter in life.</p>
<p>If your New Year&#8217;s resolution is to finally replace that worn, cracked and frost-heaved driveway that is almost impossible to shovel and could double as an ice rink, please <a title="Contact Lowell Russell Concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshohelpful-resources.php" target="_blank">give  Lowell Russell Concrete a call</a>!  Feel free to browse through our photo gallery of driveway projects for ideas, or try our design tutorial to see how to make an existing idea even better! It&#8217;s never too early to begin planning a project such as replacing your driveway or walkways. Contact us today to speak with one of our professionals and allow us to help you create the functional, durable yet beautiful driveway you desire.</p>

<p align="left">There’s a definite chill in the air these days. Temperatures are dropping and the first few flakes of snow have fallen from the sky. Winter’s impending arrival gives homeowners new concerns. One of those concerns is keeping your concrete driveway and pathways ice-free and safe for family members, friends and neighborhood dog walkers.</p>
<h3 align="left"><a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/mn-concrete-stain-lowell-russell.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignright  wp-image-340" alt="mn concrete stain lowell russell" src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/mn-concrete-stain-lowell-russell.jpg" width="319" height="205" /></a></h3>
<p align="left">To help keep pathways and <strong>concrete driveways</strong> safe, homeowners have several choices when it comes to products that de-ice concrete surfaces. Lowell Russell, the owner of <strong>Lowell Russell Concrete</strong> in Lakeville, MN, encourages homeowners to consider using sand on their concrete surfaces because it’s readily available and environmentally friendly.</p>
<p align="left">If homeowners prefer to use a deicing agent, there are several types available. Here’s a quick summary of some types of deicing compounds consumers can consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular rock salt (sodium chloride) can melt show and ice until temperatures drop to between 16 and 20 degrees Fahrenheit. This product has been known to pollute streams, rivers and lakes.</li>
<li>Calcium chloride comes in small, rounded white pellets and can melt snow and ice until temperatures fall below zero. Please note this de-icer can cause skin irritation if your hands are moist when using it.</li>
<li>Potassium chloride only melts ice when the temperature is above 15 degrees, but when combined with other chemicals, it can melt ice at lower temperatures. This product by itself  does not irritate skin and does not harm vegetation.</li>
<li>Magnesium chloride continues to melt snow and ice until the temperature drops to 13 degrees below zero. It is less toxic to plants, trees and shrubs than other deicing products.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the great things about owning your own home is performing the yearly maintenance required to keep things safe and in good repair. Great things right? Let&#8217;s be honest, some of those maintenance tasks are just plain boring and dirty chores you&#8217;d rather put-off until next year. Regardless of how hard you try, and the amount of money you throw at a problem, it remains a constant and seemingly pointless struggle. Driveways are a good example. Perhaps you&#8217;ve been tolerating a gravel driveway for years and have grown tired of mowing the stones tossed into the yard by your snow blower. Or, the asphalt paving strewn with waves and hollows requires a tanker of sealant every year to fill the ever widening cracks and glue the broken chunks back together. If this is your struggle, now is the time for a change!</p>
<p>Your driveway is probably at the top of the list when it comes to making a good impression on family and friends. It is either a welcoming, even, and sturdy pathway or a jumbled heap of stone or asphalt that has guests contemplating whether risking a broken ankle is worth the visit. A concrete driveway is extremely durable and provides many years of extremely low maintenance usage to your home. Lowell Russell Concrete can take your new driveway project from start to finish and provide an exceptional product for your dollar. Plus, with our concrete stamping, stenciling, and staining, we can create a huge variety of extraordinary and unique designs that will add distinctive personality to your home environment.</p>
<p>Please visit the <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshogallery/exterior_2.php">Lowell Russell photo gallery</a> to view examples of our previous projects, or experiment with our design tutorial to see what you can create. From simple to simply fabulous, give us a call and let us help create and install a durable driveway that provides outstanding curb appeal and exceptional function you will be proud to own for many years to come!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is your driveway starting to look like an old, well-used and abused jigsaw puzzle? Are there cracks and gaps snaking through the slabs making them appear like a dropped egg? How about wear and tear around the edges in the form or deep chips and slivered chunks?  Sounds like you may be in need of a new driveway!</p>
<p>As far as home maintenance priorities go, you may have placed remodeling your kitchen or bathroom higher on the list than repaving your driveway. A stained and chipped bathtub is a constant ugly reminder, but as long as your car doesn&#8217;t sink into oblivion there&#8217;s no problem, right? But, alas, after years of use and environmental abuse there comes a time when driveway maintenance and replacement must be done.</p>
<p>Have you had enough &#8220;fun&#8221; shoveling your cracked driveway? As your shovel slides across the buried pavement you encounter a hidden crack; your shovel digs into the crack or snags the elevated lip and immediately, forcefully stops. You feel the resounding impact up your arms, through your shoulders, and down your back. Ouch!</p>
<p>After struggling through a winter of back cracking torture spring finally arrives and reveals the wonders winter has wrought, such as cracks that have widened and crept into new spots. You may also observe that shovelfuls of snow that you thought were suspiciously heavy actually contained large chunks of your driveway. As the snow melts away these wayward hunks now decorate your lawn like a miniature rendition of Stonehenge. Face it &#8211; it&#8217;s time for a new driveway!</p>
<p>Once you’ve resigned yourself to replacing your driveway, consider the long-term value of concrete paving:</p>
<ul>
<li>Durability – Concrete has a longer life expectancy than other pavement materials, and can hold greater weight-bearing loads.</li>
<li>Traction – Surface texturizing during construction can enable your vehicle to get a better grip on the paved surface and greater safety for pedestrians.</li>
<li>Rigidity – did you know that concrete actually grows stronger over time? After the first month, your driveway will gain 10% strength during its lifetime.</li>
<li>Maintenance – Due to its durability, the need for repairs is minimal. However, if you do find yourself in need of repairs or maintenance, they are typically less extensive than asphalt and other paving surfaces</li>
<li>Cost – Again, due to its durability and low maintenance costs, concrete pavement is a sound long-term investment.</li>
<li>Environmentally friendly – Concrete can be recycled and used in a new driveway or other surface.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if you have to pave or replace, think concrete, and call Lowell Russell Concrete to discuss your wants and needs. <a href="https://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a> will do it right the first time, provide outstanding options and services, and materials that can save you both time and money in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Concrete offers many benefits over other building materials, especially when it  comes to accenting areas around your home. There is no limit to the uses  for concrete, and when you choose <a title="exterior stamped concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php">exterior stamped concrete</a>, you  will be adding beauty and interest to your home and property.</p>
<p><span id="more-210"></span><strong>Lower Maintenance</strong><br />
Wood decks rot, but concrete will last forever. When you choose  concrete, you won’t have to worry about rebuilding in fifteen  years. <a title="Concrete patios" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopatios.php">Concrete patios</a> can last for generations with a small amount of  maintenance. Where wood decks should be waterproofed annually to keep  them looking their best, concrete only requires a quick sealing coat  every few years. Unlike wood, concrete also does not attract insects  such as termites, carpenter ants and some bees.</p>
<p><strong>More Stable</strong><br />
A wood deck will only hold a certain amount of weight. But a stamped  concrete patio can handle any size hot tub you might want. Concrete is  stronger, more stable, and will not get slippery when wet. Concrete also  will not leave splinters, and it doesn’t get so hot in the sun that it  hurts to walk on.</p>
<p><strong>Possibilities</strong><br />
Exterior stamped concrete is the perfect solution for walkways going  into the backyard, or along the driveway. <a title="Concrete driveways" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodriveways.php">Concrete driveways</a> themselves can be  stamped with attractive designs, helping your house stand out more. Wrap  around porches are also fun to relax on, and when they are made from  stamped concrete, the overall appeal is increased. Pool decks and patios  are constant entertaining areas, and stamped concrete is perfect for  making them look attractive, unique and interesting. Whatever your need  is, exterior stamped concrete can fill it for a reasonable price, and  with a look that you are sure to appreciate.</p>
<p>If you want to explore the many possibilities of <a title="stamped concrete in Minneapolis MN" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php">stamped concrete in Minneapolis MN</a> for  your home or business, consider contacting <strong>Lowell  Russell Concrete,  Inc.</strong> in Minnesota, at 952-461-3710 or <a title="Request a Quote" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshorequest-a-quote.php">Request a Quote</a> online.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Concrete driveways offer many wonderful and applicable options to the  exterior of one&#8217;s home. <a title="Concrete driveways" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodriveways.php">Concrete driveways</a> are durable, look great, are  cost effective and can be maintained well.</p>
<p><span id="more-192"></span>Most homeowners want the exterior, as well as the interior to look good  and that is where a concrete driveway becomes a part of a good-looking  home. What makes a concrete driveway an asset for homeowners is its  color, texture and a traditional look that not only works well for most  homes but highlights the property value of a home.</p>
<p>What some don’t know is that concrete driveways can add an enhanced look  to one’s driveway with optional choices that give the appearance of  slate, stone or brick. Many designs are available for the homeowner;  designs that enhance and upgrade the look of most homes. Browse Lowell Russell Concrete&#8217;s <a title="photo gallery of concrete driveways" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshogallery/driveways_7.php">photo gallery of concrete driveways</a> for ideas and examples.</p>
<p>What makes concrete driveways an excellent choice for homeowners is its  functionality and its many design options. In addition, concrete  driveways heighten and enhance the value of one’s property. Concrete  also is very durable and can last up to 30 years with little maintenance  required.</p>
<p>Once a concrete driveway has been finished, it is advised to apply a  high quality sealer on the entire concrete area. This sealer will help  protect the concrete from being damaged from thaw and freeze cycles and  from absorbing moisture. This is also where it pays to invest in  high quality concrete and the experienced workmanship of a contractor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Concrete is used to pour foundations and walls in buildings and   structures around the world, which is a building material made from water, sand, gravel and  cement. Approximately six billion tons of concrete  are produced every year, and concrete is one of the most durable building materials  ever created. Together, steel and concrete can make  buildings as high as skyscrapers, but most people don&#8217;t realize the elegance and beauty of <a title="poured concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">poured concrete</a> for use around their home or business.</p>
<p><span id="more-186"></span>The most popular use of concrete that most people are familiar with is  pouring foundations for homes and <a title="driveways" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodriveways.php">driveways</a>. Concrete can also be  used to create <a title="patios" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopatios.php">patios</a> in backyards, provide  decoration in the form of <a title="steps and walkways" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshosteps.php">steps and walkways</a>, lines the outside of swimming <a title="pools" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopools.php">pools</a>, and provides the foundation for decks.</p>
<p>Plain concrete is often used for these projects, but a variant called  <a title="stamped or imprinted concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php">stamped or imprinted concrete</a> is also popular. Stamped concrete is  concrete that has been stamped or imprinted with patterns on the surface  so as to resemble brick, tile or even wood. Stamped concrete is durable, like plain concrete, and can add a certain elegance to outdoor decor. You can even customize stamped concrete to the pattern that you want, making it easy for home decorators to design the look and feel of their interior and exterior living and work spaces with durable and affordable materials.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A finished <a title="concrete driveway" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodriveways.php">concrete driveway</a> adds “shine” to a house. Cured out, textured, and stained concrete makes for a premium polish. Durable, easily maintained, and available in an array of colors, patterns, and textures, concrete is a top rate choice for quality driveway material.</p>
<p><span id="more-181"></span>Just a short while back, finished driveway materials came in asphalt or concrete, black or white (sometimes gray). Choosing which product to install centered on the cost of initial installation, product life cycle, and personal tastes.</p>
<p>A report by the American Concrete Pavement Association clears up the issue of initial cost and product life span for us (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.concreteroads.org/SR992P.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.concreteroads.org/SR992P.pdf</a>). Concrete is a better buy.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s look at taste. Your driveway is the portal to your home. Let it make a good impression. Standard coloring and textures are still available, but there has never been a time of greater choice in concrete driveway applications. The decorative options are astonishing, beautiful, and reasonably priced.</p>
<p>Matching the exterior layout and decor of your home has never been easier. Consider the large array of available texture designs offered by Lowell Russell Concrete:</p>
<p>·	Broom finish.<br />
·	Stacked bond.<br />
·	Basket weave.<br />
·	Interlocking.<br />
·	Running bond.<br />
·	Herringbone.<br />
·	Octagon square.<br />
·	Clay tile.<br />
·	Victorian.</p>
<p>With matching edging, a full crayon-pack of colors, and an easy to use online <a title="Exterior Concrete Designer" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoexterior-concrete-designer.php">Exterior Concrete Designer</a>, Lowell Russell Concrete can help you assemble the perfect look for your <a title="concrete driveway" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodriveways.php">concrete driveway</a>.
