<p>Unique and beautiful floors are growing in popularity, and many who are building new or remodeling are looking to stained concrete floors as an alternative to carpet, tile, and wood. Plain concrete floors can become jaw-dropping beautiful with the acid stain coloring process.</p>
<h3><a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/lowell-russell-concrete.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-364" alt="minnesota concrete staining" src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/lowell-russell-concrete.jpg" width="350" height="251" /></a></h3>
<p>Acid staining is a coloring process involving a chemical reaction of water, acid, and inorganic salts. These materials react with minerals already present in the concrete (calcium hydroxide) and provide color. Acid staining can be applied to new or old, plain or already colored concrete surfaces, and typically gives concrete a mottled, variegated, marble-like look. However, you may get different reactions from slab to slab. You may even see different color patterns on the same slab of concrete. The random mix of color tones and shades is what gives an acid stained floor its unique beauty, radiance, vintage or antique look.</p>
<p>Millions of feet of acid staining are done each year. Because of the many benefits, decorative concrete is flourishing and seems to be here to stay. One of the many benefits of acid staining concrete is that the finish will not fade or chip. With templates and decorative patterns, acid staining certainly enhances the look of your floor, whether residential or commercial, and many people are looking to go the route of acid staining as an alternative to the typical carpet and tile floors. This form of floor treatment can give new life to old concrete and give it the look of a luxurious granite or deep marble.</p>
<p>Floors are not the only part of your home that can be acid-stained. Exteriors, walls, and other concrete surfaces can also be decorated or colored using concrete acid stain. Concrete blocks, for example, can be decorated or colored before installation on the outside of your home. A concrete staircase, patio, or trim around doors and windows are other options to give your home a welcoming look and feel and will transform your everyday boring look into the beautiful, luxurious home you have always dreamed of owning.</p>
<p>If enhancing your floors, walls, or exterior of your home with acid stained concrete has been on your list of things to do, please give <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a> a call. You can browse through our photo gallery of interior projects for ideas.  It is never too early to begin the plans for a new project to upgrade both your home’s value and appearance.  Contact us today to speak with one of our trained professionals.</p>

<p>Becoming the new material of choice, many designers and homeowners are selecting <strong>concrete floors</strong> for their residences and businesses. Stained, painted, colored, and personalized floors are showing up in homes, offices, restaurants and, often times retail stores, malls, and schools. <strong>Stained concrete floors</strong> offer many options for interior rooms with limitless colors and designs. And flooring is not the only place you may see this lovely material. Countertops, patio tables, bathrooms, and pool areas have also become common places for <strong>decorative concrete</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/decorative-concrete-lowell-russell-concrete.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-356" alt="decorative concrete lowell russell concrete" src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/decorative-concrete-lowell-russell-concrete.jpg" width="350" height="262" /></a>Concrete is a popular material because it enhances the integrity of the architect’s designs and is easy to maintain. Floor designs do not have to have the industrial look when concrete is chosen for your flooring material. It can be designed in any way, is durable, and can be easily changed if needed. It can be designed in a unique way so that it naturally blends in with other elements of your room, and many times you may not even realize you are standing on a concrete floor! It doesn’t have to be gray and boring! Concrete floors can be colored, have textures applied, include patterns, or even monogrammed. Spice it up with stencils and paint. Polished concrete is beautifully smooth and often mistaken for marble. The sleek look makes it a versatile choice in a number of settings. Many individuals may think that the surface of polished concrete may become slippery when wet (such as in pool areas or bathrooms). However, for added slip protection, there are special anti-slip conditioners to make the concrete safe and improves traction when wet.</p>
<p>Concrete floors, countertops, and tables are gaining popularity in the design world because of its capability to be designed any way you choose. It can offer customization, functionality and extreme durability for kitchen floors and withstand elements that kitchen floors are routinely exposed to including foot traffic, food spills, dropping of utensils, etc. No other surface can resist chipping, staining or discoloring like a concrete floor or countertop!</p>
<p>With the winter season upon us, take these free weekends and spend your indoor time considering how you would like to upgrade your flooring. Don’t let the winter blues get you down! Take this time to browse our photo gallery of interior designs and let your dreams become a reality with a new look through polished, stained, or painted concrete. You won’t regret it! Give us a call today and let <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a> create and spice-up your home flooring or counter top needs!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Is it time to reseal your stained concrete? Here are some tips.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Minnessota Concrete, Stained Concrete Maintenance Tips</h2>
<p>You&#8217;ve been enjoying the beautiful <strong>stained concrete</strong> of your backyard patio or pool area for several years. After all, it’s the perfect place for you to enjoy your morning coffee, unwind after a long day, or throw a cookout and entertain friends on weekends. But, perhaps lately you&#8217;ve been noticing that it has lost some of its sheen and that water doesn&#8217;t bead up on the surface like it used to. If that’s the case, this is a great time to consider <strong>concrete resealing</strong> for your stained concrete.<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-325" alt="minnestota concrete blog, stained concrete, lowell russell concrete" src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/stained-concrete-edit-e1380037751863.jpg" width="267" height="291" /></p>
<p>Properly sealed stained concrete will help protect your investment and withstand extremes in weather and temperature much better than concrete that hasn&#8217;t been resealed in a long time. Benefits of resealing include protection from fading caused by UV rays, an improved appearance, plus protection from stains, moisture, deicing salts and other chemicals.</p>
<p>Industry experts generally recommend that resealing should be done every two or three years or as needed. Stained concrete that’s exposed to full sunlight on a consistent basis will need to be resealed more often than those surfaces that are shaded all or part of the time. Once you&#8217;ve made the decision to reseal your stained concrete, you have two choices: Should you hire a concrete company to perform the task, or should you tackle the project yourself?</p>
<p>Although resealing your stained concrete may appear to be an easy DIY task, there are a number of maintenance issues you should review before simply applying a sealant sold at a big box store. Are there any cracks in the concrete that require more than a sealant to repair? How about food or beverage stains or possible discoloration from salt applications? These will need to be carefully addressed and thoroughly cleaned away utilizing the proper cleaning chemicals and washing techniques. Is there a particular sealant that will work best for your concrete due to its exposure to sun, rain, or types of trees or plants that drop seeds or fruits that stain and blemish the concrete? Once this is all properly assessed the area is ready to receive a fresh new coat of protective sealant.</p>
<p>If you feel this is even the slightest bit beyond your DIY capabilities, please give us at <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a> a call. After all, we specialize in concrete, and caring for your existing concrete surfaces is one of our services. We will gladly inspect your concrete surface and provide you with our professional opinion and an estimate of what needs to be done to prepare the surface for sealing, the best product for your particular concrete outdoor living space, and the sealing work itself. Let the professionals at Lowell Russell Concrete help you protect your outdoor investment so you can sit back, relax, and enjoy the enhanced look and beauty of your newly resealed concrete!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not many things look more ordinary, maybe even boring, than a concrete slab. Sure they&#8217;re strong, functional and incredibly durable, but not many would ever consider them a thing of beauty. That’s all about to change. Thanks to a process called concrete staining, that kind of thinking is a thing of the past. Concrete will no longer be considered The Ugly Duckling but a Swan instead.</p>
<p><a title="Concrete Staining Services" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php#staining" target="_blank">Concrete staining</a> allows you to think of that gray slab of cement like a wonderful blank canvas that’s appearance is only limited by your imagination and creativity. That opens up a wide range of possibilities for the often taken-for-granted hero of modern construction.</p>
<p>Would you consider a concrete floor to be an eye-popping addition to a business, office or even a home? What about a beautiful concrete counter top in a kitchen? Concrete staining not only makes it possible, but it can make it absolutely gorgeous! Bring new life to patios, porches and sunrooms. Concrete staining can bring lasting beauty to any room of the house. When done by an expert, concrete staining can give the appearance of stone, slate, brick, warm, earth-toned marbling with vast depths of color, and it can even appear to have the richness of hardwoods.</p>
<p>Why is concrete staining so durable? It isn’t just a surface application, but a long lasting process that actually becomes part of the concrete. There are two types of stain. One is a chemical stain that is a water-based acidic solution that contains various metallic salts. Different mineral salts result in different colors. The solution actually reacts with the lime in the concrete to form a permanent bond that doesn’t chip off or peel away.</p>
<p>The other type of stain is considered nonreactive and is a water-based acrylic stain that doesn’t rely on a chemical reaction to produce color. These stains are made to penetrate the porous surface of the concrete and leave particles of pigment in the pores. The look is different than the acid solution process. Talk with a contractor who specializes in concrete staining to decide which type of stain is right for you.</p>
<p>If concrete staining sounds like something you are interested in bringing to your patio, home or office, contact us at <a title="Lowell Russell Concerete of Minnesota" href="https://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho" target="_blank">Lowell Russell Concrete, Inc.</a> We will be happy to work with you and show you how concrete can be a beautiful and lasting addition to any space!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post is for those who wish to make an impression upon others!</p>
<p>Imprinted concrete, also referred to as stamped, textured or patterned concrete, gives the ability to personalize and enhance your interior and exterior concrete surfaces. You can choose from hundreds of existing patterns or create your own unique design!</p>
<p>Do you have a favorite symbol or emblem, such as Fleur-de-Lis, a trinity knot, or a lotus flower? Or perhaps you wish to create an environment that imitates a specific type of material such as marble, granite, wood or tile? At Russell Lowell Concrete, we can incorporate your preferences into your interior or exterior structural designs.</p>
<p>Here are some general ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mix it up. Choose from several complementary patterns and strategically place them in a repeating or random design on your floors or patio for visual interest.</li>
<li>Give yourself an edge. Decorative patterned edging around walkways and patios can distinguish the common surface areas from your garden and provide a finished look to your exterior structures.</li>
<li>Texturize your surface. Give your floors the appearance of hardwood, your pool the look of a Romanesque pool, your countertops the sophistication of granite, or your fireplace mantel the elegance of marble.</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are few more specific ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a family crest, proudly display it on your front door step.</li>
<li>Take pride in your profession. If you are in the medical profession, incorporate a Caduceus into your design. If you are a mathematician or physicist, perhaps the Infinity symbol appeals to you.</li>
<li>Honor your faith. Integrate an Ichthys, a Celtic Cross or the Star of David into your home structures.</li>
<li>Highlight your hobby. Are you an avid gardener, a sports enthusiast, or lobbyist?  Incorporate your favorite flower, sport or political affiliation into your design.</li>
</ul>
<p>So go on, define your style, and let Lowell Russell Concrete make a lasting impression!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Lowell Russell Concrete we&#8217;re always dreaming in color, especially when it comes to decorative concrete, and we can make our dreams your reality!</p>
<p>No longer does concrete need to be displayed in drab and humdrum variations of gray, light gray and dark gray. With 24 primary colors to choose from, and countless color combinations of each, Lowell Russell Concrete can bring vibrant colors and beauty into your home through custom stained concrete. Stains can also be applied to resemble other surfaces and materials, such as natural stone, tile, marble, wood, or even leather.</p>
<p>Close your eyes&#8230;visualize the concrete around your pool as festive mosaic tiles, your fireplace mantle as stunning polished marble, your floors a richly textured hardwood, or your countertops to look like solid gleaming granite. We can quickly and easily help you achieve these appearances both inside your home and surrounding property.</p>
<p>You may ask, why imitate a substance when you could simply use actual tile, marble or wood? The answer is quite simple; concrete lasts longer while achieving the same effect. And, even better, if the concrete is already in place, you don’t have to go to the trouble and expense to rip it out and replace it with a different material.</p>
<p>How does staining work? Lowell and Russell Concrete uses a process called “Chemstaining,&#8221; which is an acidic stain that chemically reacts with cured concrete. This process can be applied to newly poured or existing concrete, and through this method, permanent, variegated or translucent effects can be fashioned into your interior and exterior concrete structures.</p>
<p>How long does the color last? Unlike a painted surface, stained concrete will hold the color as long as the concrete itself lasts, won’t fade as quickly when exposed to sunlight, or require constant maintenance and repainting as the years go by.</p>
<p>Give you home a facelift! If you want to refresh the look of your home today without completely remodeling your surfaces, give us a call. To get some ideas on how you can enhance your home visit our <a title="Photos of Lowell Russell Concrete Designs" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshogallery/">photo gallery</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Concrete floors, entryways, patios, and even countertops are the perfect  areas for <a title="decorative concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodecorative-concrete.php">decorative concrete</a>. Whether the home is a brand new one or  decades old, decorative concrete makes it simple to have the desired  look. This is especially true since there are different types available  that appeal to the different tastes that people have. Those types are  <a title="stamped, stenciled, and stained concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php">stamped, stenciled, and stained concrete</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-196"></span> Stamped concrete has a pattern upon it that is imprinted. For  those wishing to have a brick, stone, tile, or even wood appearance  that is affordable, stamped concrete can help achieve that look. It is  possible to choose from a number of popular designs or have one custom  made. This type works well with patios, courtyards, and pool decks.</p>
<p>Stenciled concrete is possible due to what is called decorative sandblast  stenciling. This allows an individual to have any design that they  desire upon their patio, driveway, countertop, or flooring. Landscaping  projects can be completely unique when this technique is used.</p>
<p>Stained concrete is another way to achieve a unique look by  having a translucent effect. A  penetrating acidic stain is applied to the concrete, which is available in a variety of colors.  Through different colors, it is easy to match the color of the home or the décor outside of the home.</p>
<p>Decorative concrete allows for a high class design without the  high class cost. There are so many options available that having a  traditional or contemporary design of virtually any color or style is not a  problem. And any area inside or outside of the home can be decorated in  this way because the concrete will last for many years.</p>

Concrete has traveled a long way from  gray sidewalks and driveways. Just a few examples of what concrete can  be used for are: sleek and durable concrete countertops, innovative  concrete walls resembling any material, and high end polished concrete  floors of any color. Decorative concrete can also give you a custom look  for a driveway,  pool, or patio area. In short, concrete can be stained  any color,  designed to imitate almost any surface, and can be used  virtually  anywhere.</p>
<p><span id="more-189"></span>Concrete has become one of the most sought after materials on the  design market for its versatility and many other good reasons. It is  less expensive than other design materials, more durable, virtually maintenance  free, and environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>One popular option is <a title="stamped concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php#stamp">stamped concrete</a>, this is typically used for  outdoor projects and the concrete can be dyed any color or combination  of colors. The concrete is stamped when it is wet to give it the look of  stone or brick. You can get the same look for half the price of  traditional materials. Just a few of the design options are custom  walkways, stairs, and retaining walls.</p>
<p>Concrete can also be polished,  and when polished it is typically used for maintenance free flooring that  will never need to be refinished or waxed! While polished floors have  mainly been used for businesses, homeowners are turning to this solution  for a custom floor that is a beautiful focal point of their home.</p>
<p>If  you have existing concrete that you do not want to replace but you do  want it to be more decorative, concrete can also be engraved. An  experienced <a title="decorative concrete installer" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php">decorative concrete installer</a> can use tools to etch designs  into the concrete. The etching can be done alone or accompanied by  staining, which can be done in any hue. Contact an experienced  decorative concrete installer today, save money, and make your design  dreams come true!</p>
