										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Lowell Russell Concrete | Lakeville, MN Concrete Driveways, Concrete Countertops, and More!</h2>
<p>Ground frost, inclement weather, and wear and tear can take its toll on concrete causing sinking, cracking, unevenness and other <strong>concrete problems</strong>. If you are experiencing any of these problems with your driveway, sidewalk, patio, or pool area, it may be time to contact the team at <strong>Lowell Russell Concrete </strong>for concrete solutions including <strong>concrete countertops</strong> and <strong>concrete driveways</strong> in Lakeville, MN.</p>
<p>The ground frost this past winter went exceptionally deep. Coupled with wear and tear, ground frost can wreak havoc on concrete streets as well as in and around our homes. It is typically best to repair cracks, sinking, and the effects of wear and tear sooner rather than later, as it may become quite expensive if repairs are not completed in a timely manner. The tough winter and spring seasons can play a huge role in concrete problems as well as your budget. High traffic concrete typically takes a lot of punishment. Proper repairs can save you from future damage as well as ensure the safety of those walking on patios and sidewalks. If you notice that cracking is a recurring problem, it may be best to call in the professionals to find the contributing factors instead of doing just cosmetic repair.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to repair interior or<strong> exterior concrete</strong>. Determining the appropriate types of materials to make proper repairs is crucial to ensure future durability. When you have a strong and well repaired floor, driveway, or sidewalk, it increases the value of your property, and ensures the safety of your family, friends, workers, or all who may enter.</p>
<p>If you have interior or <strong>exterior concrete</strong> that is cracking or sinking, breakage, potholes, or other concrete problems or worries, please give us a call. Our professional staff can address your concerns and provide the expert workmanship and quality products to correct problems or completely replace failing concrete. We’ve all been waiting for spring, and now that it is here and Mother Nature’s winter has taken its toll, get your <strong>concrete repaired</strong> for safety and increase the value of your home today. Then you can enjoy the lazy days of summer by the pool area with friends and family. Now that’s living! <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopatios.php">Contact Lowell Russell Concrete today</a>!</p>

<p>Becoming the new material of choice, many designers and homeowners are selecting <strong>concrete floors</strong> for their residences and businesses. Stained, painted, colored, and personalized floors are showing up in homes, offices, restaurants and, often times retail stores, malls, and schools. <strong>Stained concrete floors</strong> offer many options for interior rooms with limitless colors and designs. And flooring is not the only place you may see this lovely material. Countertops, patio tables, bathrooms, and pool areas have also become common places for <strong>decorative concrete</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/decorative-concrete-lowell-russell-concrete.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-356" alt="decorative concrete lowell russell concrete" src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/decorative-concrete-lowell-russell-concrete.jpg" width="350" height="262" /></a>Concrete is a popular material because it enhances the integrity of the architect’s designs and is easy to maintain. Floor designs do not have to have the industrial look when concrete is chosen for your flooring material. It can be designed in any way, is durable, and can be easily changed if needed. It can be designed in a unique way so that it naturally blends in with other elements of your room, and many times you may not even realize you are standing on a concrete floor! It doesn’t have to be gray and boring! Concrete floors can be colored, have textures applied, include patterns, or even monogrammed. Spice it up with stencils and paint. Polished concrete is beautifully smooth and often mistaken for marble. The sleek look makes it a versatile choice in a number of settings. Many individuals may think that the surface of polished concrete may become slippery when wet (such as in pool areas or bathrooms). However, for added slip protection, there are special anti-slip conditioners to make the concrete safe and improves traction when wet.</p>
<p>Concrete floors, countertops, and tables are gaining popularity in the design world because of its capability to be designed any way you choose. It can offer customization, functionality and extreme durability for kitchen floors and withstand elements that kitchen floors are routinely exposed to including foot traffic, food spills, dropping of utensils, etc. No other surface can resist chipping, staining or discoloring like a concrete floor or countertop!</p>
<p>With the winter season upon us, take these free weekends and spend your indoor time considering how you would like to upgrade your flooring. Don’t let the winter blues get you down! Take this time to browse our photo gallery of interior designs and let your dreams become a reality with a new look through polished, stained, or painted concrete. You won’t regret it! Give us a call today and let <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a> create and spice-up your home flooring or counter top needs!</p>

All of this is true, but…well, basic and uninspiring. For us at Lowell Russell, concrete, like any other substance used by humankind, is also an artistic material and medium. Yes…you heard right: artistic!...  <a class="excerpt-read-more" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoconcrete-solid-and-flexible/" title="Read Concrete: Solid AND Flexible">Read more &#187;</a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Concrete</b>. The  dictionary tells us the word means real, solid, firm, and dependable, and that It is a type of building material. All of this is true, but…well, basic and uninspiring. For us at Lowell Russell, concrete, like any other substance used by humankind, is also an artistic material and medium. Yes…you heard right: artistic!</p>
<p>Today, many folks only think of concrete as a sort of basic and utilitarian construction material simply used to create sidewalks, driveways, roads and parking ramps. For us though, that’s just the beginning. Sure, once it dries concrete is solid, tough and dependable, but while it is still wet and waiting to be formed, concrete is also pliable, mutable, and flexible.</p>
<p>Take countertops as just one example. Quarried granite is a popular choice for countertops, and it offers durability and a touch of luxury. But the buyer of the granite countertop is often limited to the narrow creativity, design and cutting abilities of the business which sells it.</p>
<p>Concrete, on the other hand, has almost limitless possibilities and potential. It can be stained, dried, sealed, mixed and sculpted to provide a vast range of visual possibilities. Take a look at our <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshogallery/countertops_3.php">photo gallery</a> for some examples. You’ll see that we are limited only by what you and our craftsman can dream up!</p>
<p>How does this make concrete flexible? Of all the building materials available, concrete provides the greatest options for creativity and function, which makes it a highly flexible product option! Color, texture, and shape are all completely at your command. Want to mimic marble? We can do that. Want a shape that isn’t standard? We can handle that too.  Are you looking for an edge to your counter top that harks back to the classical look of a Roman villa?  We can make that happen. Or perhaps your home décor calls out for a countertop with a roughhewn feel, something which calls the Adobe architecture of the Southwest to mind. Again…that’s possible.</p>
<p>In addition to shapes, we are also able to include an almost endless variety of ornamentation such as tracings or fine scroll patterns by using stamps and stains that help make your environment as individual as you are. With all the function and options concrete has to offer, it is one of the most solid yet flexible materials available!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For customers in the market for <a title="countertops" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshocountertops.php">countertops</a>, there&#8217;s no better option than concrete. Concrete seamlessly combines durability with elegant simplicity and provides countless options for design.</p>
<p><span id="more-182"></span>In addition to durability, concrete is also a sustainable, green product. Concrete contains varying combinations of natural resources, like ash, gravel, limestone, and sand—which are abundantly available locally. Using regionally produced raw materials helps to keep the carbon footprint small, and also keeps the cost lower than other materials such as granite, which would need to be shipped from another part of the country.</p>
<p>Concrete counters are handcrafted; this allows the customer to choose from numerous options to design just the right countertop for their home or business. Because the concrete is cast in molds, the customer can request unique shaping for added interest. A drainboard can be integrated into the countertop to facilitate food production. Or an integrated sink can be made from the concrete, for an efficient, streamlined appearance.</p>
<p>Many techniques are available to add patterns, color, and/or texture to concrete countertops. Staining involves the use of chemicals to create a colored or textured appearance, allowing the counter to mimic the look of tile, wood, or stone. Stenciling is done by using a sandblasting technique to create borders, logos, and original artwork. Embedding is a process by which coins, glass, fossils, stones, or other desired items are added to the counter to create a unique, customized appearance. And concrete countertops can be polished to add an elegant, high-gloss finish.</p>
<p>At Lowell Russell, we are dedicated to excellence in workmanship and customer satisfaction, and we use cutting-edge techniques and equipment to give our customers the counters they deserve.</p>
<p>If you want to investigate the many possibilities of <a title="concrete countertops" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshocountertops.php">concrete countertops</a> for your home or business, consider contacting <strong>Lowell Russell Concrete, Inc.</strong> in Minnesota, at 952-461-3710 or <a title="Request a Quote" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshorequest-a-quote.php">Request a Quote</a> online.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Homeowners are looking to concrete as the material of choice for countertops. Watching current television home design shows, the savvy home shopper notices concrete as a featured countertop material.</p>
<p><span id="more-178"></span><a title="concrete countertops" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshocountertops.php">Concrete countertops</a> for kitchen and bath look elegant and smart, yet are very durable. Concrete is made primarily from sand and water. These materials are plentiful, making it an eco-friendly choice. Natural stone countertops, such as the popular granite, are chosen for the elegance, smart appearance and durability as well, yet granite must be shipped great distances, having a much larger environmental impact.</p>
<p>Concrete is a versatile countertop material. The look can be customized in a variety of ways. By using chemical stains, coloring pigments, various aggregates and epoxy coatings, the craftsman is able to shape the appearance and texture of the concrete to simulate quarried stones such as granite, limestone or marble.</p>
<p>The homeowner has a vast array of color and finish choices available and the customization creates a unique work of art in the kitchen or bath. Because each slab of concrete is hand cast, none will be identical. The subtle variations of each piece are what many people find most attractive in the choice of concrete for home countertops.</p>
<p>The unique qualities of concrete as a design choice allow each stylish homeowner to express their own creativity, personality and passion. The design possibilities are nearly endless with concrete as the choice for countertops.</p>
<p>Make a concrete countertop even more one-of-a-kind! Use recycled materials as features in the countertop. Salvaged items such as bits of broken pottery and colored glass can be added to the concrete to personalize the countertop. These distinctive elements are aesthetically pleasing while economically and ecologically sound.</p>
<p>The long-term value of a concrete countertop is unbeatable, and its timeless beauty will endure for decades.</p>
