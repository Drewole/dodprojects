										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Stamped Concrete Driveways and Patios in Minnesota from Lowell Russell Concrete</h2>
<p>Many people enjoy the designs that can be made with bricks and traditional concrete in driveways, patios, and walkways. Unfortunately, these traditional options can leave room for weeds to pop up and spread, ruining designs like an unsightly blemish on your face. Before you accept that there’s no other option, consider a <a title="Minnesota Stamped Concrete Driveways" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php">stamped concrete driveway or patio</a> in Lakeville, MN from <a title="Home Page" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete.</a></p>
<p>With <strong>stamped concrete</strong>, you have many different options. From the design of the main layout, to choosing the border, to picking the perfect color combinations, the personalization options are endless. <strong>Stamped concrete</strong> offers a more defined pattern that sits deeper.</p>
<p>You might be thinking that a paved driveway or patio is a simpler solution for your needs, but you may be forgetting one key factor: frost. For a naturally flat surface, <strong>stamped concrete</strong> will move more smoothly with the frost and thaw cycle our area experiences each winter and spring.</p>
<p>Less invasion from weeds, high, personalized aesthetics, and freedom of movement are just a few of the major <strong>benefits of stamped concrete.</strong> You can discover more by <a title="Contact Us" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoexterior-concrete.php">contacting Lowell Russell Concrete</a> to discuss your <strong>stamped concrete</strong> options in Lakeville, MN.</p>
<p>Already set on a<strong> stamped concrete patio or driveway?</strong> Experiment with colors, designs, and borders by using our <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoexterior-concrete-designer.php">concrete designer tool</a> and visualize the next addition to your home!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post is for those who wish to make an impression upon others!</p>
<p>Imprinted concrete, also referred to as stamped, textured or patterned concrete, gives the ability to personalize and enhance your interior and exterior concrete surfaces. You can choose from hundreds of existing patterns or create your own unique design!</p>
<p>Do you have a favorite symbol or emblem, such as Fleur-de-Lis, a trinity knot, or a lotus flower? Or perhaps you wish to create an environment that imitates a specific type of material such as marble, granite, wood or tile? At Russell Lowell Concrete, we can incorporate your preferences into your interior or exterior structural designs.</p>
<p>Here are some general ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mix it up. Choose from several complementary patterns and strategically place them in a repeating or random design on your floors or patio for visual interest.</li>
<li>Give yourself an edge. Decorative patterned edging around walkways and patios can distinguish the common surface areas from your garden and provide a finished look to your exterior structures.</li>
<li>Texturize your surface. Give your floors the appearance of hardwood, your pool the look of a Romanesque pool, your countertops the sophistication of granite, or your fireplace mantel the elegance of marble.</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are few more specific ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a family crest, proudly display it on your front door step.</li>
<li>Take pride in your profession. If you are in the medical profession, incorporate a Caduceus into your design. If you are a mathematician or physicist, perhaps the Infinity symbol appeals to you.</li>
<li>Honor your faith. Integrate an Ichthys, a Celtic Cross or the Star of David into your home structures.</li>
<li>Highlight your hobby. Are you an avid gardener, a sports enthusiast, or lobbyist?  Incorporate your favorite flower, sport or political affiliation into your design.</li>
</ul>
<p>So go on, define your style, and let Lowell Russell Concrete make a lasting impression!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are three main ingredients to a successful backyard BBQ – friends, food and ambiance. We can’t help you with the friends or the food (although we would certainly appreciate an invitation!), but we can help you with the ambiance. In fact, even if you have just a few friends over or the hot dogs get a bit burned, you can still leave your guests with a favorable impression that will keep them talking for weeks to come.</p>
<p>It all comes down to the beautiful presentation that can be created in your outdoor environment by using decorative concrete. Think walkways and patios; one attractively leads the way to your event and the other brilliantly showcases it.</p>
<p>Walkways</p>
<p>Pave your path to success. One of the first things your guests will see is the walkway leading to your party. Make it memorable! By using textured or imprinted concrete you can create the illusion of stone, while adding edging along the sides can give it a distinctive look. Design the walkway to  wind and meander through your gardens to highlight your flowing garden blooms from the best angles, and as the walkway nears your patio consider adding color to make it &#8220;pop&#8221; to set the stage for your main event.</p>
<p>Patios</p>
<p>Create a focal point for your party by designing an open, airy space to welcome and comfort friends and family. A conversation pit or a fireplace will draw your guests to the center to socialize. A graduated-level patio invites folks to stroll about and provides them with various viewpoints of the yard. If space allows, combine of all three!</p>
<p>Using textured or imprinted concrete on your patio will further add to the feeling you would like to achieve; a rustic feel through a wooden texture, a modern look with smooth geometrical shapes, a poolside ambience with mosaic tile, or a personalized flair with a custom pattern.</p>
<p>Between creating the guest list and planning the menu, you’re going to be busy, and probably a little stressed. Lowell Russell Concrete is here to give you one less thing to worry about by designing and constructing the outdoor environment you dream of!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Concrete offers many benefits over other building materials, especially when it  comes to accenting areas around your home. There is no limit to the uses  for concrete, and when you choose <a title="exterior stamped concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php">exterior stamped concrete</a>, you  will be adding beauty and interest to your home and property.</p>
<p><span id="more-210"></span><strong>Lower Maintenance</strong><br />
Wood decks rot, but concrete will last forever. When you choose  concrete, you won’t have to worry about rebuilding in fifteen  years. <a title="Concrete patios" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopatios.php">Concrete patios</a> can last for generations with a small amount of  maintenance. Where wood decks should be waterproofed annually to keep  them looking their best, concrete only requires a quick sealing coat  every few years. Unlike wood, concrete also does not attract insects  such as termites, carpenter ants and some bees.</p>
<p><strong>More Stable</strong><br />
A wood deck will only hold a certain amount of weight. But a stamped  concrete patio can handle any size hot tub you might want. Concrete is  stronger, more stable, and will not get slippery when wet. Concrete also  will not leave splinters, and it doesn’t get so hot in the sun that it  hurts to walk on.</p>
<p><strong>Possibilities</strong><br />
Exterior stamped concrete is the perfect solution for walkways going  into the backyard, or along the driveway. <a title="Concrete driveways" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodriveways.php">Concrete driveways</a> themselves can be  stamped with attractive designs, helping your house stand out more. Wrap  around porches are also fun to relax on, and when they are made from  stamped concrete, the overall appeal is increased. Pool decks and patios  are constant entertaining areas, and stamped concrete is perfect for  making them look attractive, unique and interesting. Whatever your need  is, exterior stamped concrete can fill it for a reasonable price, and  with a look that you are sure to appreciate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although most people are familiar with concrete structures, such as home  foundations, many don&#8217;t consider the versatility that concrete provides.  The adaptability of concrete allows for many varieties of shapes,  designs, and logos in whatever colors or patterns the customer desires.</p>
<p><span id="more-203"></span>From public plazas to private walkways, swimming pools, and patios, a  unique look can be created by using <a title="concrete stenciling, stamping, or staining" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php">concrete stenciling, stamping, or staining</a> techniques. Either with new or existing concrete, sandblast stenciling  can create medallions, borders, or company logos which can then be  imprinted with highlights and lettering. Brickform blush-tone acid stain  can then be applied to create any color combination desired.</p>
<p>Concrete also has many functional and decorative uses inside a home or  building, such as for room additions, floors, countertops, tables, and  sinks. Indoors, <a title="decorated concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodecorative-concrete.php">decorated concrete</a> can be used to simulate other  materials such as tile, wood, or stone for a unique interior look, such  as enhancing a fireplace.</p>
<p>Customers can supply their own artwork which is camera-ready, or they  can supply their artwork on computer laser prints and disks. This  artwork can then be reproduced in the exact size desired.</p>

<p><span id="more-195"></span>Put simply, stamped concrete features patterns much like a rug might,  except that they are stamped into the material. This can create the  perfect accent for a foyer, or any other room where a hard, concrete  surface is preferred. Many people install stamped concrete into the  entrance of their homes, as this is a great way to make a first  impression to welcome guests. Check out the Lowell Russell Concrete, Inc. <a title="Photo Gallery of Decorative Concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshogallery/decorative_5.php">Photo Gallery of Decorative Concrete</a> for ideas and examples of our work.</p>
<p>Stamped concrete is not only attractive and  affordable; it&#8217;s extremely easy to clean and maintain, especially  compared to other materials, such as carpeting. Add a flavorful accent to your home, and consider making use of interior stamped concrete.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Concrete floors, entryways, patios, and even countertops are the perfect  areas for <a title="decorative concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodecorative-concrete.php">decorative concrete</a>. Whether the home is a brand new one or  decades old, decorative concrete makes it simple to have the desired  look. This is especially true since there are different types available  that appeal to the different tastes that people have. Those types are  <a title="stamped, stenciled, and stained concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php">stamped, stenciled, and stained concrete</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-196"></span> Stamped concrete has a pattern upon it that is imprinted. For  those wishing to have a brick, stone, tile, or even wood appearance  that is affordable, stamped concrete can help achieve that look. It is  possible to choose from a number of popular designs or have one custom  made. This type works well with patios, courtyards, and pool decks.</p>
<p>Stenciled concrete is possible due to what is called decorative sandblast  stenciling. This allows an individual to have any design that they  desire upon their patio, driveway, countertop, or flooring. Landscaping  projects can be completely unique when this technique is used.</p>
<p>Stained concrete is another way to achieve a unique look by  having a translucent effect. A  penetrating acidic stain is applied to the concrete, which is available in a variety of colors.  Through different colors, it is easy to match the color of the home or the décor outside of the home.</p>
<p>Decorative concrete allows for a high class design without the  high class cost. There are so many options available that having a  traditional or contemporary design of virtually any color or style is not a  problem. And any area inside or outside of the home can be decorated in  this way because the concrete will last for many years.</p>

<p><span id="more-189"></span>Concrete has become one of the most sought after materials on the  design market for its versatility and many other good reasons. It is  less expensive than other design materials, more durable, virtually maintenance  free, and environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>One popular option is <a title="stamped concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php#stamp">stamped concrete</a>, this is typically used for  outdoor projects and the concrete can be dyed any color or combination  of colors. The concrete is stamped when it is wet to give it the look of  stone or brick. You can get the same look for half the price of  traditional materials. Just a few of the design options are custom  walkways, stairs, and retaining walls.</p>
<p>Concrete can also be polished,  and when polished it is typically used for maintenance free flooring that  will never need to be refinished or waxed! While polished floors have  mainly been used for businesses, homeowners are turning to this solution  for a custom floor that is a beautiful focal point of their home.</p>
<p>If  you have existing concrete that you do not want to replace but you do  want it to be more decorative, concrete can also be engraved. An  experienced <a title="decorative concrete installer" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php">decorative concrete installer</a> can use tools to etch designs  into the concrete. The etching can be done alone or accompanied by  staining, which can be done in any hue. Contact an experienced  decorative concrete installer today, save money, and make your design  dreams come true!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Concrete is one of the most commonly used materials in the world of  construction, and can be found just about anywhere you look. <a title="Stamped concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php#stamp">Stamped  concrete</a>, in particular is prized for its durability and visual appeal, and can be used in situations where the concrete is meant to  imitate another, more expensive materials.</p>
<p><span id="more-188"></span>For instance, many people use <a title="stamped concrete that resembles brick for the walkway to the front door" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshogallery/steps-walkways_12.php"> stamped concrete that resembles brick for the walkway to the front door</a>,  as stamped concrete is very attractive but costs only a fraction of  what more expensive materials might cost. Other stamped concrete  imitations include slate, wood and even tile.</p>
<p>Caring for stamped concrete is not unlike maintaining any other form of  concrete. What must be taken note of, however, is that stamped concrete  has grooves in it while regular flat concrete does not. It is important  to take extra care in making sure these grooves are free of debris. Power washing with hot water is the best way to make  sure your <a title="exterior concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoexterior-concrete.php">exterior concrete</a> is clean, and is an easy, inexpensive  method. However, a quick spray with the garden hose will suffice with regular maintenance. For oil stains, you may want to use an alkaline degreaser with  the wash.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Concrete is used to pour foundations and walls in buildings and   structures around the world, which is a building material made from water, sand, gravel and  cement. Approximately six billion tons of concrete  are produced every year, and concrete is one of the most durable building materials  ever created. Together, steel and concrete can make  buildings as high as skyscrapers, but most people don&#8217;t realize the elegance and beauty of <a title="poured concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">poured concrete</a> for use around their home or business.</p>
<p><span id="more-186"></span>The most popular use of concrete that most people are familiar with is  pouring foundations for homes and <a title="driveways" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodriveways.php">driveways</a>. Concrete can also be  used to create <a title="patios" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopatios.php">patios</a> in backyards, provide  decoration in the form of <a title="steps and walkways" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshosteps.php">steps and walkways</a>, lines the outside of swimming <a title="pools" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopools.php">pools</a>, and provides the foundation for decks.</p>
<p>Plain concrete is often used for these projects, but a variant called  <a title="stamped or imprinted concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php">stamped or imprinted concrete</a> is also popular. Stamped concrete is  concrete that has been stamped or imprinted with patterns on the surface  so as to resemble brick, tile or even wood. Stamped concrete is durable, like plain concrete, and can add a certain elegance to outdoor decor. You can even customize stamped concrete to the pattern that you want, making it easy for home decorators to design the look and feel of their interior and exterior living and work spaces with durable and affordable materials.</p>
