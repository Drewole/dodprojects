										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Lowell Russell Concrete | Providing concrete pools in Lakeville, MN and surrounding communities</h2>
<p>With nicer weather upon us and the itch to be outside after the long, harsh winter, let your mind wander to the lazy days of summer! Think scorching hot rays of the sun, an even tan, and cooling off in the swimming pool. Sounds awesome, uplifting and a real treat, right? Have you thought about installing your own pool, or do you currently have a pool that is beginning to look a little weathered and needs some attention? Now is the time to think this project through, whether you need repairs or wish to begin the planning process to build your own pool. Contact the professionals at <strong>Lowell Russell Concrete</strong> for inspiring ideas, designs, and shapes for your <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopools.php"><strong>concrete pool</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Concrete swimming pools</strong> have a great advantage when compared to other types of pools such as fiberglass or vinyl lined pools. Vinyl lined pools have been shown to be less durable, and the risk of tears, stains, and leaks is much higher when compared to concrete. <strong>Concrete pools</strong> can be customized and feature additional amenities such as waterfalls if desired. The shapes and designs are endless, depending on your wants, needs, and desires. Another enhancement for added attraction is to line the pool with tiles, thus adding a unique, eye-catching look.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you already have a pool or are thinking of installing one, proper upkeep and repair is a necessity. A pool that is properly winterized can be readied for the summer months relatively easily and will last for many, many years.</p>
<p>A backyard oasis can be yours by installing not only a pool, but a patio and serene surroundings as well. Maybe you’ve always dreamed of a spa or a pool and pool house to entertain your guests. Perhaps a grotto, a fire pit, or an outdoor kitchen is on your bucket list. All of this can be accomplished with a little creative planning!</p>
<p><a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoexterior-concrete.php">Contact the professional team at Lowell Russell Concrete today</a> to discuss and plan your <strong>concrete pool</strong>, patio, and other items to create your own backyard oasis. Like the saying says, “Relax and take in the abundance of life.” &#8211; Author Unknown.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Is it time to reseal your stained concrete? Here are some tips.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Minnessota Concrete, Stained Concrete Maintenance Tips</h2>
<p>You&#8217;ve been enjoying the beautiful <strong>stained concrete</strong> of your backyard patio or pool area for several years. After all, it’s the perfect place for you to enjoy your morning coffee, unwind after a long day, or throw a cookout and entertain friends on weekends. But, perhaps lately you&#8217;ve been noticing that it has lost some of its sheen and that water doesn&#8217;t bead up on the surface like it used to. If that’s the case, this is a great time to consider <strong>concrete resealing</strong> for your stained concrete.<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-325" alt="minnestota concrete blog, stained concrete, lowell russell concrete" src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/stained-concrete-edit-e1380037751863.jpg" width="267" height="291" /></p>
<p>Properly sealed stained concrete will help protect your investment and withstand extremes in weather and temperature much better than concrete that hasn&#8217;t been resealed in a long time. Benefits of resealing include protection from fading caused by UV rays, an improved appearance, plus protection from stains, moisture, deicing salts and other chemicals.</p>
<p>Industry experts generally recommend that resealing should be done every two or three years or as needed. Stained concrete that’s exposed to full sunlight on a consistent basis will need to be resealed more often than those surfaces that are shaded all or part of the time. Once you&#8217;ve made the decision to reseal your stained concrete, you have two choices: Should you hire a concrete company to perform the task, or should you tackle the project yourself?</p>
<p>Although resealing your stained concrete may appear to be an easy DIY task, there are a number of maintenance issues you should review before simply applying a sealant sold at a big box store. Are there any cracks in the concrete that require more than a sealant to repair? How about food or beverage stains or possible discoloration from salt applications? These will need to be carefully addressed and thoroughly cleaned away utilizing the proper cleaning chemicals and washing techniques. Is there a particular sealant that will work best for your concrete due to its exposure to sun, rain, or types of trees or plants that drop seeds or fruits that stain and blemish the concrete? Once this is all properly assessed the area is ready to receive a fresh new coat of protective sealant.</p>
<p>If you feel this is even the slightest bit beyond your DIY capabilities, please give us at <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a> a call. After all, we specialize in concrete, and caring for your existing concrete surfaces is one of our services. We will gladly inspect your concrete surface and provide you with our professional opinion and an estimate of what needs to be done to prepare the surface for sealing, the best product for your particular concrete outdoor living space, and the sealing work itself. Let the professionals at Lowell Russell Concrete help you protect your outdoor investment so you can sit back, relax, and enjoy the enhanced look and beauty of your newly resealed concrete!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With late-summer temperatures still reaching into the 80s and 90s, now is a great time to throw a backyard patio or pool party. So, give your friends and neighbors a call, fire up the grill and throw a fun, casual bash before school starts.</p>
<p>Traditional summer party fare, such as coleslaw, chips, hamburgers and hot dogs, are sure crowd pleasers, but maybe you would like to offer your guests a little something different. Here are a few fun ideas you can use for your late-summer get-together.</p>
<p><strong>Market Fresh:</strong> Utilize the bounty of fresh produce from your garden or local farmer’s market to create healthy and delicious fare. Boil or grill several ears of fresh sweet corn and serve them with melted butter. For extra flavor, add chopped parsley and minced garlic to the butter. Ask your guests to bring a fresh bowl of Pico de Gallo or salsa and they can vote on their favorites. For desert, serve chocolate-zucchini brownies and raspberry bars.</p>
<p><strong>Pizza Party:</strong> Make or buy pizza dough and fashion it into six-inch rounds. Offer several popular pizza toppings, including sauce, sausage, chicken, sweet peppers, onions, spinach, olives, and a variety of cheeses, and ask your guests to make their own pies. Cook them on the grill so you don’t have to turn on the oven and heat up your kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>More S’mores:</strong> Create a fun and inexpensive s’mores bar for your guests. To up the ante from traditional s’mores, lay out a selection of graham crackers, including traditional, cinnamon and chocolate. Add a variety of marshmallows, such as strawberry, chocolate and vanilla, and caramel and vanilla. Build a chocolate platter, using milk, dark and white chocolate, peanut butter cups and Andes mints. Treat your guests to a variety of non-traditional toppings – jam, lemon curd, fresh strawberries, banana and apple slices.</p>
<p>If these ideas sound great to you, but you don’t have a backyard patio for entertaining friends and family, contact the professionals at <a title="Concrete Professionals at Lowell Russell Concrete" href="https://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a>. They’ll design and install a <a title="Concrete Patio built by Lowell Russell Concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopatios.php">beautiful backyard patio</a> or pool area that you can enjoy for years to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Swimming pools come in many different sizes and shapes and fulfill a variety of purposes. Regardless of the type or function of the pool, all pools can be enhanced with a decorative concrete pool deck. The area surrounding the pool should not only provide a safe, slip-resistant surface, but also complement your home and the look you want.</p>
<p>Going for a themed approach? At Lowell and Russell Concrete we can you help you bring your theme to life!</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural – if you want your pool to blend with the surrounding area, you may wish to choose a natural brushed or polished stone appearance. You can then choose a color which seamlessly blends with your landscaping such as brown, gray, white, beige, gold or pink, or a combination of these colors. Final touches may include a few tumbled boulders placed strategically around the pool deck.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Roman – if you prefer to relax in your pool or sun yourself in a  lounge in a chair beside the pool, imagine yourself in a more luxurious setting consisting of a Roman theme with a mosaic tile appearance in a variety of colors or clear with gold accents. Complete the theme with a few period-style Roman statutes around the edges .</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Modern – as a snazzy complement to your urban home and lifestyle, you may wish to consider a sleek pool deck with a dark grey slate appearance, black and red accents, and sharp geometrical shapes and edges.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Retro – pick your favorite decade! Want to go back to the roaring 20’s, fabulous 50’s, or the swinging 60’s? We can help you recreate the era of your choice through a unique blend of concrete imprinting and staining.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Zen – ah, perhaps your inner most desire involves a pool to soothe the mind and body after a long, stressful day. Consider an organic ambiance with the pool framed by a soft white stone appearance and an inviting secluded pebble-textured lounging area that provides a peaceful and quiet setting.</li>
</ul>
<p>The possibilities are endless. You can choose to stay true with the theme, or combine several themes to make your pool uniquely yours. Bring your ideas to <a href="https://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a> and we will help turn your dreams into a refreshing reality!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Concrete offers many benefits over other building materials, especially when it  comes to accenting areas around your home. There is no limit to the uses  for concrete, and when you choose <a title="exterior stamped concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php">exterior stamped concrete</a>, you  will be adding beauty and interest to your home and property.</p>
<p><span id="more-210"></span><strong>Lower Maintenance</strong><br />
Wood decks rot, but concrete will last forever. When you choose  concrete, you won’t have to worry about rebuilding in fifteen  years. <a title="Concrete patios" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopatios.php">Concrete patios</a> can last for generations with a small amount of  maintenance. Where wood decks should be waterproofed annually to keep  them looking their best, concrete only requires a quick sealing coat  every few years. Unlike wood, concrete also does not attract insects  such as termites, carpenter ants and some bees.</p>
<p><strong>More Stable</strong><br />
A wood deck will only hold a certain amount of weight. But a stamped  concrete patio can handle any size hot tub you might want. Concrete is  stronger, more stable, and will not get slippery when wet. Concrete also  will not leave splinters, and it doesn’t get so hot in the sun that it  hurts to walk on.</p>
<p><strong>Possibilities</strong><br />
Exterior stamped concrete is the perfect solution for walkways going  into the backyard, or along the driveway. <a title="Concrete driveways" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodriveways.php">Concrete driveways</a> themselves can be  stamped with attractive designs, helping your house stand out more. Wrap  around porches are also fun to relax on, and when they are made from  stamped concrete, the overall appeal is increased. Pool decks and patios  are constant entertaining areas, and stamped concrete is perfect for  making them look attractive, unique and interesting. Whatever your need  is, exterior stamped concrete can fill it for a reasonable price, and  with a look that you are sure to appreciate.</p>
<p>If you want to explore the many possibilities of <a title="stamped concrete in Minneapolis MN" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php">stamped concrete in Minneapolis MN</a> for  your home or business, consider contacting <strong>Lowell  Russell Concrete,  Inc.</strong> in Minnesota, at 952-461-3710 or <a title="Request a Quote" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshorequest-a-quote.php">Request a Quote</a> online.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Concrete is a versatile material, and using concrete to build interior or exterior pools offers significant advantages over a fiberglass pool.  The primary reason to choose a <a title="concrete pool" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopools.php">concrete pool</a> is the unlimited  flexibility. Concrete can be poured to fit a space of any size. Most  fiberglass pools come only in preset designs, whereas a concrete pool can be  customized to a particular shape without increasing the cost by much.  This allows for complete creativity, limited only by  imagination.</p>
<p><span id="more-193"></span> A concrete pool may be less expensive than comparable fiberglass pools.  Concrete is a renewable and environmentally-friendly resource, and tends  to reflect heat away. This can help to keep the pool area cool, perfect  for summer pool parties.</p>
<p>Recent advances in concrete techniques have  led to concrete that can have a number of different textures and colors.  The high durability offered by concrete keeps normal wear-and-tear from  unpleasantly deteriorating a concrete pool. Concrete also does not emit  harmful emissions like some fiberglass pools may. As a natural  resource, concrete is unlikely to trigger an allergy, and a concrete pool  can be easily cleaned and requires no special chemicals or techniques.</p>
<p>Like all construction projects, choosing a concrete pool contractor  should be thoroughly researched. Browse our <a title="concrete pool photo gallery" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshogallery/pools_8.php">concrete pool photo gallery</a> for examples of our work. Recommendations can also be solicited. If you check  with the Better Business Bureau you&#8217;ll notice we have consistently been recognized for excellent customer satisfaction. Choosing a concrete company with an established reputation can ensure  that if problems do happen, customer service can handle them.</p>

Concrete can also be  used to create <a title="patios" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopatios.php">patios</a> in backyards, provide  decoration in the form of <a title="steps and walkways" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshosteps.php">steps and walkways</a>, lines the outside of swimming <a title="pools" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopools.php">pools</a>, and provides the foundation for decks.</p>
<p>Plain concrete is often used for these projects, but a variant called  <a title="stamped or imprinted concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php">stamped or imprinted concrete</a> is also popular. Stamped concrete is  concrete that has been stamped or imprinted with patterns on the surface  so as to resemble brick, tile or even wood. Stamped concrete is durable, like plain concrete, and can add a certain elegance to outdoor decor. You can even customize stamped concrete to the pattern that you want, making it easy for home decorators to design the look and feel of their interior and exterior living and work spaces with durable and affordable materials.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For both interior and outdoor underground pools, nothing beats concrete. A <a title="concrete pools" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopools.php">concrete pool</a> is not only superior to other pools in durability and design but it is also a great way to relax and enjoy the summer weather. Concrete pools are also just a little way to show off, which can be done modestly or with flair.</p>
<p><span id="more-179"></span>Design is the number one benefit in concrete pools. With concrete, there is no limit to shape, size, edging, and features. Concrete allows a person to express a pool design aesthetic by creating something original and unique. Once the basic shape and size are determined, concrete can also be stamped and stained for further refinement. Earth tone stain can lend an air of natural beauty that cannot be matched by other materials or plain gray concrete. Stamping the concrete can also create unique designs and texture on both the pool walls and deck.</p>
<p>Other benefits of concrete pools include their durability. Concrete will last for years, and a lifetime if properly maintained. Concrete pools are also the safest on the market. Tile can be slick and cause dangerous accidents. The texture of concrete helps to prevent falls. Concrete pools are also easy to clean. Most spills can be cleaned with a simple spray of a garden hose.</p>
<p>Lowell Russell Concrete has been serving Minnesota for over 35 years and they have the experience and skill to create a <a title="concrete pool" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopools.php">concrete pool</a> meeting virtually any design specification. A Lowell Russell Concrete pool is one that can be shown off for years to come as both a mark of achievement and design.</p>
