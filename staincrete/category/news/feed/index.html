<p>Spring is just a few days away, or so the calendar states. Many are beginning to get Spring Fever and hoping to get outside, roll up their sleeves, and start cleaning up after our harsh Midwest winter. With spring in the air, the construction business will begin to ramp up as well. The visualization of planting some flowers and a garden, cleaning up the yard, and walking with our galoshes to make splashes and sloshes sounds quite appealing. With spring thinking, perhaps a new or updated patio is also on your list of jobs to be done. <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a> can help you fulfill your dream of getting into the “spring” of things with <strong>stamped concrete patios</strong> in Lakeville, MN.</p>
<p><strong>Stamped concrete</strong> is becoming more and more popular in today’s market. A<strong> stamped concrete patio</strong> gives you the look of a stone patio for a lot less than pavers or other options. Pavers can be much more labor intense and time consuming, whereas stamped concrete requires less maintenance with a simple coat of clear sealer every few years. The biggest advantage of <strong>stamped concrete</strong> is its versatility, plus there&#8217;s no worry about tripping hazards as it is one continuous slab of concrete. Because the pattern is stamped into the concrete the “stones” won’t settle over time or create uneven surfaces. Grass and weeds will not sprout between the stones as there is no grout, joints, or filler for the weeds to sneak through.</p>
<p>With the look to mimic brick, cobblestones, or cracked earth, <strong>stamped concrete</strong> is sure to fit in with your entertaining décor. Different patterns, shapes, and textures are readily available in many different colors to give your patio the look you desire and become the inviting retreat for yourself and your guests.<br />
If you already have a concrete patio that is in good shape, you can add a stamped finish to achieve the look you desire. Remember, though, that you will be raising the height of the old slab, so you will want to be certain the new surface doesn&#8217;t interfere with things like existing steps and foundation walls.</p>

<p>Becoming the new material of choice, many designers and homeowners are selecting <strong>concrete floors</strong> for their residences and businesses. Stained, painted, colored, and personalized floors are showing up in homes, offices, restaurants and, often times retail stores, malls, and schools. <strong>Stained concrete floors</strong> offer many options for interior rooms with limitless colors and designs. And flooring is not the only place you may see this lovely material. Countertops, patio tables, bathrooms, and pool areas have also become common places for <strong>decorative concrete</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/decorative-concrete-lowell-russell-concrete.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-356" alt="decorative concrete lowell russell concrete" src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/decorative-concrete-lowell-russell-concrete.jpg" width="350" height="262" /></a>Concrete is a popular material because it enhances the integrity of the architect’s designs and is easy to maintain. Floor designs do not have to have the industrial look when concrete is chosen for your flooring material. It can be designed in any way, is durable, and can be easily changed if needed. It can be designed in a unique way so that it naturally blends in with other elements of your room, and many times you may not even realize you are standing on a concrete floor! It doesn’t have to be gray and boring! Concrete floors can be colored, have textures applied, include patterns, or even monogrammed. Spice it up with stencils and paint. Polished concrete is beautifully smooth and often mistaken for marble. The sleek look makes it a versatile choice in a number of settings. Many individuals may think that the surface of polished concrete may become slippery when wet (such as in pool areas or bathrooms). However, for added slip protection, there are special anti-slip conditioners to make the concrete safe and improves traction when wet.</p>
<p>Concrete floors, countertops, and tables are gaining popularity in the design world because of its capability to be designed any way you choose. It can offer customization, functionality and extreme durability for kitchen floors and withstand elements that kitchen floors are routinely exposed to including foot traffic, food spills, dropping of utensils, etc. No other surface can resist chipping, staining or discoloring like a concrete floor or countertop!</p>
<p>With the winter season upon us, take these free weekends and spend your indoor time considering how you would like to upgrade your flooring. Don’t let the winter blues get you down! Take this time to browse our photo gallery of interior designs and let your dreams become a reality with a new look through polished, stained, or painted concrete. You won’t regret it! Give us a call today and let <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a> create and spice-up your home flooring or counter top needs!</p>
