										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Stamped Concrete Driveways and Patios in Minnesota from Lowell Russell Concrete</h2>
<p>Many people enjoy the designs that can be made with bricks and traditional concrete in driveways, patios, and walkways. Unfortunately, these traditional options can leave room for weeds to pop up and spread, ruining designs like an unsightly blemish on your face. Before you accept that there’s no other option, consider a <a title="Minnesota Stamped Concrete Driveways" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php">stamped concrete driveway or patio</a> in Lakeville, MN from <a title="Home Page" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete.</a></p>
<p>With <strong>stamped concrete</strong>, you have many different options. From the design of the main layout, to choosing the border, to picking the perfect color combinations, the personalization options are endless. <strong>Stamped concrete</strong> offers a more defined pattern that sits deeper.</p>
<p>You might be thinking that a paved driveway or patio is a simpler solution for your needs, but you may be forgetting one key factor: frost. For a naturally flat surface, <strong>stamped concrete</strong> will move more smoothly with the frost and thaw cycle our area experiences each winter and spring.</p>
<p>Less invasion from weeds, high, personalized aesthetics, and freedom of movement are just a few of the major <strong>benefits of stamped concrete.</strong> You can discover more by <a title="Contact Us" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoexterior-concrete.php">contacting Lowell Russell Concrete</a> to discuss your <strong>stamped concrete</strong> options in Lakeville, MN.</p>

<p>As spring-like weather finally begins to show its face in Southeastern Minnesota, it is time to get rid of the winter doldrums and spend time outside. One of the most gratifying ways to do this is to spend time relaxing on the patio. If grilling, entertaining, and spending time with family and friends is something you do best, a patio is the perfect choice to get the job done. Contact <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho"><strong>Lowell Russell Concrete</strong> </a>to get the long overdue project of a Lakeville, MN <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopatios.php"><strong>concrete patio</strong></a> started today.</p>
<p>Relaxation is something most of us need more of. Because of hectic schedules, family obligations, and work, relaxation often times takes the back seat. This eventually makes us tense, stressed, and unhealthy. Having a <strong>concrete patio</strong> with some comfortable chairs, a table, and other amenities provides plentiful amounts of enjoyment and delight. A time to relax, take in the sun and Mother Nature’s gifts, visit with family and friends, or read a good book—all of which decrease our stress level and make us happier and healthier.</p>
<p>Whether you choose a concrete slab, pavers, or some other design and style, a patio is sure to provide years of enjoyment, delight, and pleasure. At the end of the day, when you want a retreat from the busy-ness around you, your patio can become your sanctuary. Perhaps flower gardens or rock gardens along with a fountain mixed-in next to or within your patio can provide hours of relaxation. Stoke up a fire, start the grill, get some comfortable furniture, and invite friends or family to enjoy a festive barbeque. On a calm summers eve take in the fragrances of fresh blossoms in your beautiful, serene yard. Or simply enjoy the atmosphere with a good book and quiet time to appreciate the sounds and scents of nature around you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Lowell Russell Concrete | Lakeville, MN Concrete Installation and Preservation</h2>
<p>If you look around your home, you will see that you probably have quite a bit of <strong>concrete</strong> – from sidewalks to patios to driveways. With the harsh winters in the Midwest, the ground frost has a depth of several feet, particularly this year with the sub-zero temperatures hitting us for many consecutive days. Because of this, ice can form below concrete surfaces and cause it to heave or crack. Many experts say that the bigger the crack, the bigger the problem. Frost heaving of concrete is the result of pressure created from a combination of freezing temperatures and soil defrosting and is one of the main reasons for damage to patios, sidewalks, driveways, and even streets or highways. If concrete is installed and poured properly, heaving can be avoided and your patio or sidewalk will look as perfect when spring rolls around as it did last summer before the cold and freezing temperatures were upon us. The professionals at<strong> Lowell Russell Concrete</strong> take pride in their work and will make every effort to get and keep your Lakeville, MN <strong>concrete project</strong> just the way you dreamed it would be—free of heaving or cracking and beautiful to show off to guests.</p>
<p><strong>Curing of concrete</strong> is an important aspect of keeping your <strong>concrete patio</strong> or area looking great and holding up during the harsh winters and thawing springs in the Midwest. With proper curing and hydration, the strength, durability, and look of the concrete are increased greatly. Proper and complete curing generally requires a period of 7-10 days after pouring of the concrete. Warmer weather and hydration are typically needed for concrete to cure properly and allow for a durable surface. If you have no other option than to pour concrete during a colder time of the year, frost blankets should be used to ensure proper curing.</p>
<p>There are several different types of cracks and heaving that you need to look for in keeping your concreting in top-notch condition:<br />
• Hairline cracks are quite small and typically do not threaten the structure of your <strong>concrete</strong>, but they can become a point for ground water to enter, thus making the problem worse with time.<br />
• Spalling is flaking, peeling, and erosion of the top layer of concrete and is typically caused by expansion and contraction of moisture during the freeze and thaw cycles.<br />
• Settling is a sagging or caving of the concrete. This often times results from poorly drained or poorly compacted soil, causing the ground underneath to be unstable.<br />
• Heaving as noted above is caused from the freeze and thaw cycles.</p>
<p>Because the changing weather is constantly attacking homeowners, <strong>concrete sealing</strong> plays an important role along with proper installation, upkeep and maintenance. <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Contact the trained professionals at <strong>Lowell Russell Concrete</strong></a> to help with proper installation of your <strong>concrete project</strong> to make your dreams come true. Keep this quote in mind, “Your dreams are like the cement. If you water it with actions, it becomes a hard concrete mass. But if you leave it exposed and unwatered, the air will easily blow it away!” ― Israelmore Avivor</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With late-summer temperatures still reaching into the 80s and 90s, now is a great time to throw a backyard patio or pool party. So, give your friends and neighbors a call, fire up the grill and throw a fun, casual bash before school starts.</p>
<p>Traditional summer party fare, such as coleslaw, chips, hamburgers and hot dogs, are sure crowd pleasers, but maybe you would like to offer your guests a little something different. Here are a few fun ideas you can use for your late-summer get-together.</p>
<p><strong>Market Fresh:</strong> Utilize the bounty of fresh produce from your garden or local farmer’s market to create healthy and delicious fare. Boil or grill several ears of fresh sweet corn and serve them with melted butter. For extra flavor, add chopped parsley and minced garlic to the butter. Ask your guests to bring a fresh bowl of Pico de Gallo or salsa and they can vote on their favorites. For desert, serve chocolate-zucchini brownies and raspberry bars.</p>
<p><strong>Pizza Party:</strong> Make or buy pizza dough and fashion it into six-inch rounds. Offer several popular pizza toppings, including sauce, sausage, chicken, sweet peppers, onions, spinach, olives, and a variety of cheeses, and ask your guests to make their own pies. Cook them on the grill so you don’t have to turn on the oven and heat up your kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>More S’mores:</strong> Create a fun and inexpensive s’mores bar for your guests. To up the ante from traditional s’mores, lay out a selection of graham crackers, including traditional, cinnamon and chocolate. Add a variety of marshmallows, such as strawberry, chocolate and vanilla, and caramel and vanilla. Build a chocolate platter, using milk, dark and white chocolate, peanut butter cups and Andes mints. Treat your guests to a variety of non-traditional toppings – jam, lemon curd, fresh strawberries, banana and apple slices.</p>
<p>If these ideas sound great to you, but you don’t have a backyard patio for entertaining friends and family, contact the professionals at <a title="Concrete Professionals at Lowell Russell Concrete" href="https://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a>. They’ll design and install a <a title="Concrete Patio built by Lowell Russell Concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopatios.php">beautiful backyard patio</a> or pool area that you can enjoy for years to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ah, finally &#8211; PATIO WEATHER! We&#8217;ve waited EXTRA long for it this year in Minnesota, and now that it&#8217;s here, we should enjoy it to the fullest! Here are seven of our favorite things to do outside on the patio…what are some of yours?</p>
<p>1) <b>Enjoy Your Morning Coffee</b>. Pour a hot, steaming cup of coffee, fix it just the way you like it, and then head outside to the patio. Nestle into your favorite lawn chair and let yourself be bathed in the mix of cool morning breezes and warm rising sun. This is especially nice to do on the weekend, but even on a weekday, you’ll be amazed at how much better your days go.</p>
<p>2) <b>Unwind after the workday</b>. You return home from a day at the office, and soon it will be time to start your evening chores. But for right now, loosen your collar, head on out to the patio, and relax with a cool beverage as the evening shadows start to lengthen. What a great way to decompress after the day.</p>
<p>3) <b>Watch the birds</b>. Put up a feeder within view of the patio, and as you lounge on your patio furniture, watch in silent content as a dazzling array of colorful song birds arrive and depart from the feeder.</p>
<p>4) <b>Break Time</b>. You’ve just finished mowing the grass in heat of the summer sun. There&#8217;s plenty more tasks to get done, but for right now, turn to your trusty patio and take a break. Find a chair in the cooling shade, slake your thirst with an ice cold glass of fresh lemonade, and relax a bit before resuming your chores.</p>
<p>5) <b>Grill</b>. Okay, this is a no-brainer, but is there any better aroma that screams &#8220;SUMMER!!&#8221; than your favorite food being seared on the grill? Burgers, brats, chicken, fish, or even just veggies- the wonderful smells and tastes of grilling out on the patio are just awesome and we all know it!</p>
<p>6) <b>Host a party</b>. Take the grill, a cooler of cold drinks, a table, some chairs, a mix of great food, add some friends and&#8230;BAM!&#8230;you’ve got an awesome patio party! A great way to relax with friends or get to know your neighbors a little better.</p>
<p><b>Enjoy the Fact that you don’t have to apply sealant this year</b>. Okay, so this one is a shameless plug for the easy care and durability of concrete, but you know what? It’s true! Most of these activities can be done on a wooden deck too, but at some point this summer, you’re going to have shut it all down, pressure clean the wood, fix or replace damaged boards, and treat it with a sealant to protect it from nature&#8217;s wrath. And if you like to grill, well, wood and fire don&#8217;t mix well, and any spills can soak into the wood and leave permanent and unsightly stains, grease spots and residue. But if you’ve got a concrete patio, the maintenance needs are drastically reduced, clean-up is a breeze, which allows you to just keep having fun out back on your patio!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are three main ingredients to a successful backyard BBQ – friends, food and ambiance. We can’t help you with the friends or the food (although we would certainly appreciate an invitation!), but we can help you with the ambiance. In fact, even if you have just a few friends over or the hot dogs get a bit burned, you can still leave your guests with a favorable impression that will keep them talking for weeks to come.</p>
<p>It all comes down to the beautiful presentation that can be created in your outdoor environment by using decorative concrete. Think walkways and patios; one attractively leads the way to your event and the other brilliantly showcases it.</p>
<p>Walkways</p>
<p>Pave your path to success. One of the first things your guests will see is the walkway leading to your party. Make it memorable! By using textured or imprinted concrete you can create the illusion of stone, while adding edging along the sides can give it a distinctive look. Design the walkway to  wind and meander through your gardens to highlight your flowing garden blooms from the best angles, and as the walkway nears your patio consider adding color to make it &#8220;pop&#8221; to set the stage for your main event.</p>
<p>Patios</p>
<p>Create a focal point for your party by designing an open, airy space to welcome and comfort friends and family. A conversation pit or a fireplace will draw your guests to the center to socialize. A graduated-level patio invites folks to stroll about and provides them with various viewpoints of the yard. If space allows, combine of all three!</p>
<p>Using textured or imprinted concrete on your patio will further add to the feeling you would like to achieve; a rustic feel through a wooden texture, a modern look with smooth geometrical shapes, a poolside ambience with mosaic tile, or a personalized flair with a custom pattern.</p>
<p>Between creating the guest list and planning the menu, you’re going to be busy, and probably a little stressed. Lowell Russell Concrete is here to give you one less thing to worry about by designing and constructing the outdoor environment you dream of!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Concrete offers many benefits over other building materials, especially when it  comes to accenting areas around your home. There is no limit to the uses  for concrete, and when you choose <a title="exterior stamped concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php">exterior stamped concrete</a>, you  will be adding beauty and interest to your home and property.</p>
<p><span id="more-210"></span><strong>Lower Maintenance</strong><br />
Wood decks rot, but concrete will last forever. When you choose  concrete, you won’t have to worry about rebuilding in fifteen  years. <a title="Concrete patios" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopatios.php">Concrete patios</a> can last for generations with a small amount of  maintenance. Where wood decks should be waterproofed annually to keep  them looking their best, concrete only requires a quick sealing coat  every few years. Unlike wood, concrete also does not attract insects  such as termites, carpenter ants and some bees.</p>
<p><strong>More Stable</strong><br />
A wood deck will only hold a certain amount of weight. But a stamped  concrete patio can handle any size hot tub you might want. Concrete is  stronger, more stable, and will not get slippery when wet. Concrete also  will not leave splinters, and it doesn’t get so hot in the sun that it  hurts to walk on.</p>
<p><strong>Possibilities</strong><br />
Exterior stamped concrete is the perfect solution for walkways going  into the backyard, or along the driveway. <a title="Concrete driveways" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodriveways.php">Concrete driveways</a> themselves can be  stamped with attractive designs, helping your house stand out more. Wrap  around porches are also fun to relax on, and when they are made from  stamped concrete, the overall appeal is increased. Pool decks and patios  are constant entertaining areas, and stamped concrete is perfect for  making them look attractive, unique and interesting. Whatever your need  is, exterior stamped concrete can fill it for a reasonable price, and  with a look that you are sure to appreciate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looking for a new creative way to dress up your home? Why not try a new decorative <a title="concrete patio" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopatios.php">concrete patio</a>. There are many types of flooring that you could choose for your patio; but concrete will give you a longer lasting, durable result, with a variety of decorative options.</p>
<p><span id="more-191"></span>Concrete patios are as hard as stone and hold up under the kind of bumps and scrapes that can occur when moving around heavy stone patio furniture. Another benefit to concrete is the low maintenance. Just reseal your floor once every two to three years to keep up that beautiful, vibrant color and/or shine.</p>
<p>The original look and feel of the standard poured concrete is just fine for many people. You, however, don&#8217;t have to settle for the ordinary. With concrete you can bring the style and elegance of your indoor living, or dining room outdoors. Before it sets, workers can mark the concrete in any design or pattern of your choice, and it can be stained to match any color or decor. Concrete can also be sanded and polished until the surface is as smooth as glass, or grooved and textured to look like real stone slabs.</p>
<p>When finished your <a title="decorative concrete patio" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshogallery/patios_9.php">decorative concrete patio</a> will have the look of an elegant stone, brick, granite, or marble floor that will astound you. Place a cozy open fire pit in the center and surround it with some comfy lounging chairs, and maybe a potted plant or two, and you&#8217;ll have a beautiful outdoor living space that you&#8217;ll be proud to show off.</p>
<p>Investigate the many <a title="samples of what can be done with concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshogallery/">samples of what can be done with concrete</a>; and don&#8217;t be afraid to ask your contractor for advice.</p>
<p>If you want to explore the many possibilities of <a title="concrete patios" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopatios.php">concrete patios</a> for your home or business, consider contacting <strong>Lowell  Russell Concrete, Inc.</strong> in Minnesota, at 952-461-3710 or <a title="Request a Quote" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshorequest-a-quote.php">Request a Quote</a> online.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Concrete is used to pour foundations and walls in buildings and   structures around the world, which is a building material made from water, sand, gravel and  cement. Approximately six billion tons of concrete  are produced every year, and concrete is one of the most durable building materials  ever created. Together, steel and concrete can make  buildings as high as skyscrapers, but most people don&#8217;t realize the elegance and beauty of <a title="poured concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">poured concrete</a> for use around their home or business.</p>
<p><span id="more-186"></span>The most popular use of concrete that most people are familiar with is  pouring foundations for homes and <a title="driveways" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodriveways.php">driveways</a>. Concrete can also be  used to create <a title="patios" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopatios.php">patios</a> in backyards, provide  decoration in the form of <a title="steps and walkways" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshosteps.php">steps and walkways</a>, lines the outside of swimming <a title="pools" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopools.php">pools</a>, and provides the foundation for decks.</p>
<p>Plain concrete is often used for these projects, but a variant called  <a title="stamped or imprinted concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php">stamped or imprinted concrete</a> is also popular. Stamped concrete is  concrete that has been stamped or imprinted with patterns on the surface  so as to resemble brick, tile or even wood. Stamped concrete is durable, like plain concrete, and can add a certain elegance to outdoor decor. You can even customize stamped concrete to the pattern that you want, making it easy for home decorators to design the look and feel of their interior and exterior living and work spaces with durable and affordable materials.</p>
