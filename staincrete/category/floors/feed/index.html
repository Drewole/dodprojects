<p>Unique and beautiful floors are growing in popularity, and many who are building new or remodeling are looking to stained concrete floors as an alternative to carpet, tile, and wood. Plain concrete floors can become jaw-dropping beautiful with the acid stain coloring process.</p>
<h3><a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/lowell-russell-concrete.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-364" alt="minnesota concrete staining" src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/lowell-russell-concrete.jpg" width="350" height="251" /></a></h3>
<p>Acid staining is a coloring process involving a chemical reaction of water, acid, and inorganic salts. These materials react with minerals already present in the concrete (calcium hydroxide) and provide color. Acid staining can be applied to new or old, plain or already colored concrete surfaces, and typically gives concrete a mottled, variegated, marble-like look. However, you may get different reactions from slab to slab. You may even see different color patterns on the same slab of concrete. The random mix of color tones and shades is what gives an acid stained floor its unique beauty, radiance, vintage or antique look.</p>
<p>Millions of feet of acid staining are done each year. Because of the many benefits, decorative concrete is flourishing and seems to be here to stay. One of the many benefits of acid staining concrete is that the finish will not fade or chip. With templates and decorative patterns, acid staining certainly enhances the look of your floor, whether residential or commercial, and many people are looking to go the route of acid staining as an alternative to the typical carpet and tile floors. This form of floor treatment can give new life to old concrete and give it the look of a luxurious granite or deep marble.</p>
<p>Floors are not the only part of your home that can be acid-stained. Exteriors, walls, and other concrete surfaces can also be decorated or colored using concrete acid stain. Concrete blocks, for example, can be decorated or colored before installation on the outside of your home. A concrete staircase, patio, or trim around doors and windows are other options to give your home a welcoming look and feel and will transform your everyday boring look into the beautiful, luxurious home you have always dreamed of owning.</p>
<p>If enhancing your floors, walls, or exterior of your home with acid stained concrete has been on your list of things to do, please give <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a> a call. You can browse through our photo gallery of interior projects for ideas.  It is never too early to begin the plans for a new project to upgrade both your home’s value and appearance.  Contact us today to speak with one of our trained professionals.</p>

<p>Becoming the new material of choice, many designers and homeowners are selecting <strong>concrete floors</strong> for their residences and businesses. Stained, painted, colored, and personalized floors are showing up in homes, offices, restaurants and, often times retail stores, malls, and schools. <strong>Stained concrete floors</strong> offer many options for interior rooms with limitless colors and designs. And flooring is not the only place you may see this lovely material. Countertops, patio tables, bathrooms, and pool areas have also become common places for <strong>decorative concrete</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/decorative-concrete-lowell-russell-concrete.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-356" alt="decorative concrete lowell russell concrete" src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/decorative-concrete-lowell-russell-concrete.jpg" width="350" height="262" /></a>Concrete is a popular material because it enhances the integrity of the architect’s designs and is easy to maintain. Floor designs do not have to have the industrial look when concrete is chosen for your flooring material. It can be designed in any way, is durable, and can be easily changed if needed. It can be designed in a unique way so that it naturally blends in with other elements of your room, and many times you may not even realize you are standing on a concrete floor! It doesn’t have to be gray and boring! Concrete floors can be colored, have textures applied, include patterns, or even monogrammed. Spice it up with stencils and paint. Polished concrete is beautifully smooth and often mistaken for marble. The sleek look makes it a versatile choice in a number of settings. Many individuals may think that the surface of polished concrete may become slippery when wet (such as in pool areas or bathrooms). However, for added slip protection, there are special anti-slip conditioners to make the concrete safe and improves traction when wet.</p>
<p>Concrete floors, countertops, and tables are gaining popularity in the design world because of its capability to be designed any way you choose. It can offer customization, functionality and extreme durability for kitchen floors and withstand elements that kitchen floors are routinely exposed to including foot traffic, food spills, dropping of utensils, etc. No other surface can resist chipping, staining or discoloring like a concrete floor or countertop!</p>
<p>With the winter season upon us, take these free weekends and spend your indoor time considering how you would like to upgrade your flooring. Don’t let the winter blues get you down! Take this time to browse our photo gallery of interior designs and let your dreams become a reality with a new look through polished, stained, or painted concrete. You won’t regret it!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Concrete floors" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshofloors.php">Concrete floors</a> that have been stained, colored, or painted are the  newest material of choice for both homer designers and homeowners. When  these floors are installed, they are acid-stained then sealed with a  concrete sealer so that they will be water-resistant as well as  impervious to stains, dirt, and anything abrasive.</p>
<p><span id="more-199"></span>If you own a home with one of these beautiful new floors or are thinking  of having one installed, it’s good to know that care and maintenance is  easy and not very labor intensive.</p>
<p>Dusting frequently to remove dust and dirt will help safeguard against  any abrasion, which may take away from the shine. Some experts recommend  a micro-fiber mop and using overlapping and uninterrupted mopping  motions.</p>
<p>To get rid of stains and set in dirt, regular damp mopping with cool  water will help keep your concrete floor shiny. If you use a cleaner, use one  with a neutral pH balance – not too acidic and not too alkaline. Make  sure the mop is just slightly damp and not completely wet. Mops like the  Swiffer Wet-Jet are not recommended because the cleaners that come with  them contain solvents that will streak the sealer on your floor and  leave it looking hazy.</p>
<p>In order to keep up the natural shine to your concrete floor, the floors  can be occasionally waxed or simply buffing the floor with a polishing  compound will do the trick.</p>
<p>If you live in the upper Midwest, Lowell Russell Concrete, Inc. can help  you with all of your concrete flooring needs, from installing to  repairing and care and maintenance.</p>
<p>If you want to explore the many possibilities of <a title="concrete floors MN" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshofloors.php">concrete floors MN</a> for  your home or business, consider contacting <strong>Lowell  Russell Concrete,  Inc.</strong> in Minnesota, at 952-461-3710 or <a title="Request a Quote" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshorequest-a-quote.php">Request a Quote</a> online.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When searching for the perfect material for your floor, one of the greatest alternatives to marble, tile, and block is stained concrete. Builders understand <a title="concrete flooring" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshofloors.php">concrete flooring</a> is one of the most versatile products in use today, because almost any look can be created and match the surroundings of a driveway, cement floor, concrete wall, pool deck, patio, or walkway.</p>
<p><span id="more-177"></span>The magic of concrete floors are that the stained concrete can be made to look just like marble, wood, stone, and even leather. Not only is stained concrete used for outdoor flooring, it can even be used to create a spectacular looking floor for indoor rooms. Stained concrete is also much less expensive than any of the aforementioned options for flooring, and one can create a superior look for a fraction of the cost.</p>
<p>Concrete staining is achieved by applying an acid-based stain to a concrete slab. The way the concrete takes the stain is different in each instance, which leads to a unique look from project to project. Usually the stains used for concrete produce an earthy array of tones such as: brown, terra cotta, tan, and blue-green. Although there are manufacturers that have developed other colors, subtle earthy tones are a perfect accent for outdoor areas. And concrete staining creates absolutely gorgeous floors that will look exactly like other types of flooring.</p>
<p>One of the biggest benefits of stained concrete as opposed to other flooring methods is that the bond of the stain to the concrete is very tough and the stain will not chip, crack, or fade. And, not only is cement durable and allows the stain to hold up over time, it looks magnificent and each project brings a new distinct and custom look that will add character and richness to any outdoor or indoor area or room. Therefore, stained concrete is the best and longest lasting flooring solution there is.</p>
