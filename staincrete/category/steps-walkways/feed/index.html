<p align="left">There’s a definite chill in the air these days. Temperatures are dropping and the first few flakes of snow have fallen from the sky. Winter’s impending arrival gives homeowners new concerns. One of those concerns is keeping your concrete driveway and pathways ice-free and safe for family members, friends and neighborhood dog walkers.</p>
<h3 align="left"><a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/mn-concrete-stain-lowell-russell.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignright  wp-image-340" alt="mn concrete stain lowell russell" src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/mn-concrete-stain-lowell-russell.jpg" width="319" height="205" /></a></h3>
<p align="left">To help keep pathways and <strong>concrete driveways</strong> safe, homeowners have several choices when it comes to products that de-ice concrete surfaces. Lowell Russell, the owner of <strong>Lowell Russell Concrete</strong> in Lakeville, MN, encourages homeowners to consider using sand on their concrete surfaces because it’s readily available and environmentally friendly.</p>
<p align="left">If homeowners prefer to use a deicing agent, there are several types available. Here’s a quick summary of some types of deicing compounds consumers can consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular rock salt (sodium chloride) can melt show and ice until temperatures drop to between 16 and 20 degrees Fahrenheit. This product has been known to pollute streams, rivers and lakes.</li>
<li>Calcium chloride comes in small, rounded white pellets and can melt snow and ice until temperatures fall below zero. Please note this de-icer can cause skin irritation if your hands are moist when using it.</li>
<li>Potassium chloride only melts ice when the temperature is above 15 degrees, but when combined with other chemicals, it can melt ice at lower temperatures. This product by itself  does not irritate skin and does not harm vegetation.</li>
<li>Magnesium chloride continues to melt snow and ice until the temperature drops to 13 degrees below zero. It is less toxic to plants, trees and shrubs than other deicing products.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are three main ingredients to a successful backyard BBQ – friends, food and ambiance. We can’t help you with the friends or the food (although we would certainly appreciate an invitation!), but we can help you with the ambiance. In fact, even if you have just a few friends over or the hot dogs get a bit burned, you can still leave your guests with a favorable impression that will keep them talking for weeks to come.</p>
<p>It all comes down to the beautiful presentation that can be created in your outdoor environment by using decorative concrete. Think walkways and patios; one attractively leads the way to your event and the other brilliantly showcases it.</p>
<p>Walkways</p>
<p>Pave your path to success. One of the first things your guests will see is the walkway leading to your party. Make it memorable! By using textured or imprinted concrete you can create the illusion of stone, while adding edging along the sides can give it a distinctive look. Design the walkway to  wind and meander through your gardens to highlight your flowing garden blooms from the best angles, and as the walkway nears your patio consider adding color to make it &#8220;pop&#8221; to set the stage for your main event.</p>
<p>Patios</p>
<p>Create a focal point for your party by designing an open, airy space to welcome and comfort friends and family. A conversation pit or a fireplace will draw your guests to the center to socialize. A graduated-level patio invites folks to stroll about and provides them with various viewpoints of the yard. If space allows, combine of all three!</p>
<p>Using textured or imprinted concrete on your patio will further add to the feeling you would like to achieve; a rustic feel through a wooden texture, a modern look with smooth geometrical shapes, a poolside ambience with mosaic tile, or a personalized flair with a custom pattern.</p>
<p>Between creating the guest list and planning the menu, you’re going to be busy, and probably a little stressed. Lowell Russell Concrete is here to give you one less thing to worry about by designing and constructing the outdoor environment you dream of!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Concrete offers many benefits over other building materials, especially when it  comes to accenting areas around your home. There is no limit to the uses  for concrete, and when you choose <a title="exterior stamped concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php">exterior stamped concrete</a>, you  will be adding beauty and interest to your home and property.</p>
<p><span id="more-210"></span><strong>Lower Maintenance</strong><br />
Wood decks rot, but concrete will last forever. When you choose  concrete, you won’t have to worry about rebuilding in fifteen  years. <a title="Concrete patios" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopatios.php">Concrete patios</a> can last for generations with a small amount of  maintenance. Where wood decks should be waterproofed annually to keep  them looking their best, concrete only requires a quick sealing coat  every few years. Unlike wood, concrete also does not attract insects  such as termites, carpenter ants and some bees.</p>
<p><strong>More Stable</strong><br />
A wood deck will only hold a certain amount of weight. But a stamped  concrete patio can handle any size hot tub you might want. Concrete is  stronger, more stable, and will not get slippery when wet. Concrete also  will not leave splinters, and it doesn’t get so hot in the sun that it  hurts to walk on.</p>
<p><strong>Possibilities</strong><br />
Exterior stamped concrete is the perfect solution for walkways going  into the backyard, or along the driveway. <a title="Concrete driveways" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodriveways.php">Concrete driveways</a> themselves can be  stamped with attractive designs, helping your house stand out more. Wrap  around porches are also fun to relax on, and when they are made from  stamped concrete, the overall appeal is increased. Pool decks and patios  are constant entertaining areas, and stamped concrete is perfect for  making them look attractive, unique and interesting. Whatever your need  is, exterior stamped concrete can fill it for a reasonable price, and  with a look that you are sure to appreciate.</p>
<p>If you want to explore the many possibilities of <a title="stamped concrete in Minneapolis MN" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php">stamped concrete in Minneapolis MN</a> for  your home or business, consider contacting <strong>Lowell  Russell Concrete,  Inc.</strong> in Minnesota, at 952-461-3710 or <a title="Request a Quote" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshorequest-a-quote.php">Request a Quote</a> online.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many building options to make decisions about while in the middle of a  construction or landscaping project. Concrete has become such a versatile building material in the  last 10 years, that even <a title="concrete steps, stairs, and walkways" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshosteps.php">concrete steps, stairs, and walkways</a> can be styled to fit any aesthetic you can imagine.</p>
<p><span id="more-194"></span>First off, why choose concrete over wood or metal? Well, concrete will  not rust, corrode, or decompose. A quick hose off or swift of a broom  can make it look brand new again.</p>
<p>Second, there aren&#8217;t as many options available to customize the look of wood to your own taste, and it can get  pretty pricey to customize metalwork. Whereas with concrete, you can change the look and feel with a variety of <a title="stamped textures, stains, or stencils" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php">stamped textures, stains, or stencils</a>, and concrete looks great year round no matter what climate you live it. Who wants to  shovel snow off wooden steps or grab ahold of a metal rail  when it is over 100 degrees outside?</p>
<p>Third, concrete steps and walkways can be poured right on site, or if you don&#8217;t want the mess or your area blocked  off during the finishing process, it may be possible to have sections made off site and brought in.</p>
<p>When deciding the right type of concrete styling for your home or business, you can let your imagination run  wild. Contact a reputable, trustworthy concrete contractor to discuss the project. At Lowell Russell Concrete in Minnesota, we&#8217;ll make sure to review all options within your budget and style, and help you discover the limitless potential of building with concrete.</p>

<p><span id="more-186"></span>The most popular use of concrete that most people are familiar with is  pouring foundations for homes and <a title="driveways" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodriveways.php">driveways</a>. Concrete can also be  used to create <a title="patios" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopatios.php">patios</a> in backyards, provide  decoration in the form of <a title="steps and walkways" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshosteps.php">steps and walkways</a>, lines the outside of swimming <a title="pools" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopools.php">pools</a>, and provides the foundation for decks.</p>
<p>Plain concrete is often used for these projects, but a variant called  <a title="stamped or imprinted concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php">stamped or imprinted concrete</a> is also popular. Stamped concrete is  concrete that has been stamped or imprinted with patterns on the surface  so as to resemble brick, tile or even wood. Stamped concrete is durable, like plain concrete, and can add a certain elegance to outdoor decor. You can even customize stamped concrete to the pattern that you want, making it easy for home decorators to design the look and feel of their interior and exterior living and work spaces with durable and affordable materials.</p>

Concrete is mainly used as an exterior substance for building and designing, and it is affordable for the average homeowner. <a title="Steps, walkways, and staircases can all be constructed from concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshosteps.php">Steps, walkways, and staircases can all be constructed from concrete</a> because concrete is a substance that conforms to any figure or structure. Concrete is also weather-proof, which allows it to be used anywhere. Practically any design can be constructed into a physical structure made of concrete, especially walkways and steps.</p>
<p><span id="more-85"></span>Concrete gives homeowners the ability to create almost anything out of the rock-like substance. Where as some commercial building supplies cost high prices, concrete is cheap for the amount of volume it can create. Creating steps, walkways, and staircases out of concrete is an excellent idea because of the low cost, the durability against the elements, and the ability to create any design the mind can fathom. Constructing beautiful concrete stairs can be accomplished by a trained expert, and the cement will be ready for use within a few days. Concrete structures can even be used inside, and finished with a variety of materials such as wood, carpet, or tile. It also offers longevity compared to many other materials, and concrete is water proof, so flood damage will not occur on contact.</p>
<p>Concrete sidewalks and steps can be decorated with colors and designs to match or complement any surroundings. The possibilities are endless when it comes to creating concrete walkways and staircases. Professional concrete companies can help homeowners achieve stunning visual effects by combining decorative concrete walkways and color-stained stairways and landings that coordinate colors and patterns.</p>
