										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Concrete Staining in Minnesota by Lowell Russell Concrete</h2>
<p>Unique and beautiful floors are growing in popularity, and many who are building new or remodeling are looking to stained concrete floors as an alternative to carpet, tile, and wood. Plain concrete floors can become jaw-dropping beautiful with the acid stain coloring process.</p>
<h3><a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/lowell-russell-concrete.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-364" alt="minnesota concrete staining" src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/lowell-russell-concrete.jpg" width="350" height="251" /></a></h3>
<p>Acid staining is a coloring process involving a chemical reaction of water, acid, and inorganic salts. These materials react with minerals already present in the concrete (calcium hydroxide) and provide color. Acid staining can be applied to new or old, plain or already colored concrete surfaces, and typically gives concrete a mottled, variegated, marble-like look. However, you may get different reactions from slab to slab. You may even see different color patterns on the same slab of concrete. The random mix of color tones and shades is what gives an acid stained floor its unique beauty, radiance, vintage or antique look.</p>
<p>Millions of feet of acid staining are done each year. Because of the many benefits, decorative concrete is flourishing and seems to be here to stay. One of the many benefits of acid staining concrete is that the finish will not fade or chip. With templates and decorative patterns, acid staining certainly enhances the look of your floor, whether residential or commercial, and many people are looking to go the route of acid staining as an alternative to the typical carpet and tile floors. This form of floor treatment can give new life to old concrete and give it the look of a luxurious granite or deep marble.</p>
<p>Floors are not the only part of your home that can be acid-stained. Exteriors, walls, and other concrete surfaces can also be decorated or colored using concrete acid stain. Concrete blocks, for example, can be decorated or colored before installation on the outside of your home. A concrete staircase, patio, or trim around doors and windows are other options to give your home a welcoming look and feel and will transform your everyday boring look into the beautiful, luxurious home you have always dreamed of owning.</p>
<p>If enhancing your floors, walls, or exterior of your home with acid stained concrete has been on your list of things to do, please give <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a> a call. You can browse through our photo gallery of interior projects for ideas.  It is never too early to begin the plans for a new project to upgrade both your home’s value and appearance.  Contact us today to speak with one of our trained professionals.</p>

A fireplace can give your home an inviting and comfy feeling and typically brings to mind relaxed nights spent with loved ones in front of a blazing hearth.</p>
<p>For hundreds of years a fireplace was a masonry box constructed of mortar and brick or stone where wood was burned for warmth. Thanks to the demands for energy conservation this simplistic concept has changed over the past few decades. Dedicated architecture and energy efficient designs create a dedicated space to burn anything from wood to gas. Some fireplaces house an electric heating device, while others don&#8217;t provide any heat at all and merely serve as a decorative construct with a beautiful mantel for displays, knick-knacks, or heirlooms.</p>
<p>If you purchased a home with an older fireplace, now may be the perfect time for a fireplace facelift. Lightweight stones can add rustic charm to any hearth, or a Victorian style mantle in marble or slate could be just the look you wish to achieve. With varieties of fireplace and mantle designs too numerous to count, you can choose the look that is perfect for your home. Carved limestone, marble, flat stones, rounded boulders, or coarse volcanic rock can be chosen to match the color scheme and feel of your home. Different designs such as colonial, contemporary, rustic, log cabin, modern, or old world are just a few choices. And it is not only the type of stone that you choose, but the color, shape and design of your fireplace and mantel that will create the final work of art.</p>
<p>If giving your fireplace a facelift is something you have been putting off for years and you are considering a timeless look that will warm up your future holiday gatherings, now may be the time to tackle the fireplace facelift.  Please give <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a> a call. You can browse through our photo gallery of fireplaces for ideas and inspiration. It is never too early to begin the plans for a new project to upgrade both your home’s value and appearance.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Lowell Russell Concrete in Minnesota provides tips</h2>
<h2>for adding decorative concrete to beautify your home</h2>
<p>Who says a <strong>concrete driveway</strong> needs to be the same old plain, boring utilitarian slab of concrete almost every house in the neighborhood displays from garage to street? Minnesota concrete company, <strong><a title="MN ConcreteCompany, Lowell Russell Concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho" target="_blank">Lowell Russell Concrete</a></strong>, offers  <strong><a title="MN Decorative Concrete, Concrete Driveway" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoexterior-concrete.php" target="_blank">decorative concrete</a> </strong>advice on  how to create a unique design that will increase your home’s curb appeal while also being functional and long lasting!</p>
<p>There are many types of options available to create a <a title="MN Concrete Driveways | Lowell Russell Concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodriveways.php" target="_blank"><strong>concrete driveway</strong></a> that fits the style of your home. Perhaps a driveway the offers the look of multicolored and textured <strong>concrete pavers</strong> will give your home the perfect look. Complete your home’s unique appearance by continuing the concrete paver theme on the walkway and steps leading to your front door. With a wide range of colors and patterns to select from, you will certainly find an artistic theme that is not only highly functional and tough, but provides a warm and welcoming entryway from the street to your home!</p>
<p><a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/MN-concrete-companies-lowell-russell-concrete2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-352" alt="MN concrete companies lowell russell concrete2" src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/MN-concrete-companies-lowell-russell-concrete2.jpg" width="320" height="240" /></a>Properly preparing for your new concrete driveway is an important factor. Slope, drainage, lighting and surface are important details that need to be considered. While wanting the visual appeal, it is also important to look for features such as traction and a non-slippery material to prevent slick, hazardous steps and walkways, especially with hillside or sloped driveways. As is often seen with the Midwest winters, slippery, ice-covered walkways or stairways can be dangerous for family, friends, and visitors.</p>
<p>Another type of paving material that is becoming increasingly common is pervious concrete, as its benefits are many. Pervious concrete is an easy to clean material that prevents areas of potentially hazardous pooling of water, a problem in both summer and winter, making the drive or walkway much safer during every season. It can be used for sidewalks, patios, driveways and many other areas around your business or home.</p>
<p>Another solution for keeping your walkway, driveway, or stairway clear of ice and snow may be a snow melting system. There are several options available such as mats or cables that are perfect for both residential and commercial properties. With these options, you will have the peace of mind that comes with knowing you will have a safe walkway, driveway, and entry to your home. Instead of salting, which can be hard on the concrete surface, or chipping and shoveling ice and packed snow, you will have time to enjoy the things that matter in life.</p>
<p>If your New Year&#8217;s resolution is to finally replace that worn, cracked and frost-heaved driveway that is almost impossible to shovel and could double as an ice rink, please <a title="Contact Lowell Russell Concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshohelpful-resources.php" target="_blank">give  Lowell Russell Concrete a call</a>!  Feel free to browse through our photo gallery of driveway projects for ideas, or try our design tutorial to see how to make an existing idea even better! It&#8217;s never too early to begin planning a project such as replacing your driveway or walkways.

<p>Becoming the new material of choice, many designers and homeowners are selecting <strong>concrete floors</strong> for their residences and businesses. Stained, painted, colored, and personalized floors are showing up in homes, offices, restaurants and, often times retail stores, malls, and schools. <strong>Stained concrete floors</strong> offer many options for interior rooms with limitless colors and designs. And flooring is not the only place you may see this lovely material. Countertops, patio tables, bathrooms, and pool areas have also become common places for <strong>decorative concrete</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/decorative-concrete-lowell-russell-concrete.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-356" alt="decorative concrete lowell russell concrete" src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/decorative-concrete-lowell-russell-concrete.jpg" width="350" height="262" /></a>Concrete is a popular material because it enhances the integrity of the architect’s designs and is easy to maintain. Floor designs do not have to have the industrial look when concrete is chosen for your flooring material. It can be designed in any way, is durable, and can be easily changed if needed. It can be designed in a unique way so that it naturally blends in with other elements of your room, and many times you may not even realize you are standing on a concrete floor! It doesn’t have to be gray and boring! Concrete floors can be colored, have textures applied, include patterns, or even monogrammed. Spice it up with stencils and paint. Polished concrete is beautifully smooth and often mistaken for marble. The sleek look makes it a versatile choice in a number of settings. Many individuals may think that the surface of polished concrete may become slippery when wet (such as in pool areas or bathrooms). However, for added slip protection, there are special anti-slip conditioners to make the concrete safe and improves traction when wet.</p>
<p>Concrete floors, countertops, and tables are gaining popularity in the design world because of its capability to be designed any way you choose. It can offer customization, functionality and extreme durability for kitchen floors and withstand elements that kitchen floors are routinely exposed to including foot traffic, food spills, dropping of utensils, etc. No other surface can resist chipping, staining or discoloring like a concrete floor or countertop!</p>
<p>With the winter season upon us, take these free weekends and spend your indoor time considering how you would like to upgrade your flooring. Don’t let the winter blues get you down! Take this time to browse our photo gallery of interior designs and let your dreams become a reality with a new look through polished, stained, or painted concrete. You won’t regret it! Give us a call today and let <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a> create and spice-up your home flooring or counter top needs!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Is it time to reseal your stained concrete? Here are some tips.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Minnessota Concrete, Stained Concrete Maintenance Tips</h2>
<p>You&#8217;ve been enjoying the beautiful <strong>stained concrete</strong> of your backyard patio or pool area for several years. After all, it’s the perfect place for you to enjoy your morning coffee, unwind after a long day, or throw a cookout and entertain friends on weekends. But, perhaps lately you&#8217;ve been noticing that it has lost some of its sheen and that water doesn&#8217;t bead up on the surface like it used to. If that’s the case, this is a great time to consider <strong>concrete resealing</strong> for your stained concrete.<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-325" alt="minnestota concrete blog, stained concrete, lowell russell concrete" src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/stained-concrete-edit-e1380037751863.jpg" width="267" height="291" /></p>
<p>Properly sealed stained concrete will help protect your investment and withstand extremes in weather and temperature much better than concrete that hasn&#8217;t been resealed in a long time. Benefits of resealing include protection from fading caused by UV rays, an improved appearance, plus protection from stains, moisture, deicing salts and other chemicals.</p>
<p>Industry experts generally recommend that resealing should be done every two or three years or as needed. Stained concrete that’s exposed to full sunlight on a consistent basis will need to be resealed more often than those surfaces that are shaded all or part of the time. Once you&#8217;ve made the decision to reseal your stained concrete, you have two choices: Should you hire a concrete company to perform the task, or should you tackle the project yourself?</p>
<p>Although resealing your stained concrete may appear to be an easy DIY task, there are a number of maintenance issues you should review before simply applying a sealant sold at a big box store. Are there any cracks in the concrete that require more than a sealant to repair? How about food or beverage stains or possible discoloration from salt applications? These will need to be carefully addressed and thoroughly cleaned away utilizing the proper cleaning chemicals and washing techniques. Is there a particular sealant that will work best for your concrete due to its exposure to sun, rain, or types of trees or plants that drop seeds or fruits that stain and blemish the concrete? Once this is all properly assessed the area is ready to receive a fresh new coat of protective sealant.</p>
<p>If you feel this is even the slightest bit beyond your DIY capabilities, please give us at <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a> a call. After all, we specialize in concrete, and caring for your existing concrete surfaces is one of our services. We will gladly inspect your concrete surface and provide you with our professional opinion and an estimate of what needs to be done to prepare the surface for sealing, the best product for your particular concrete outdoor living space, and the sealing work itself. Let the professionals at Lowell Russell Concrete help you protect your outdoor investment so you can sit back, relax, and enjoy the enhanced look and beauty of your newly resealed concrete!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not many things look more ordinary, maybe even boring, than a concrete slab. Sure they&#8217;re strong, functional and incredibly durable, but not many would ever consider them a thing of beauty. That’s all about to change. Thanks to a process called concrete staining, that kind of thinking is a thing of the past. Concrete will no longer be considered The Ugly Duckling but a Swan instead.</p>
<p><a title="Concrete Staining Services" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php#staining" target="_blank">Concrete staining</a> allows you to think of that gray slab of cement like a wonderful blank canvas that’s appearance is only limited by your imagination and creativity. That opens up a wide range of possibilities for the often taken-for-granted hero of modern construction.</p>
<p>Would you consider a concrete floor to be an eye-popping addition to a business, office or even a home? What about a beautiful concrete counter top in a kitchen? Concrete staining not only makes it possible, but it can make it absolutely gorgeous! Bring new life to patios, porches and sunrooms. Concrete staining can bring lasting beauty to any room of the house. When done by an expert, concrete staining can give the appearance of stone, slate, brick, warm, earth-toned marbling with vast depths of color, and it can even appear to have the richness of hardwoods.</p>
<p>Why is concrete staining so durable? It isn’t just a surface application, but a long lasting process that actually becomes part of the concrete. There are two types of stain. One is a chemical stain that is a water-based acidic solution that contains various metallic salts. Different mineral salts result in different colors. The solution actually reacts with the lime in the concrete to form a permanent bond that doesn’t chip off or peel away.</p>
<p>The other type of stain is considered nonreactive and is a water-based acrylic stain that doesn’t rely on a chemical reaction to produce color. These stains are made to penetrate the porous surface of the concrete and leave particles of pigment in the pores. The look is different than the acid solution process. Talk with a contractor who specializes in concrete staining to decide which type of stain is right for you.</p>
<p>If concrete staining sounds like something you are interested in bringing to your patio, home or office, contact us at <a title="Lowell Russell Concerete of Minnesota" href="https://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho" target="_blank">Lowell Russell Concrete, Inc.</a> We will be happy to work with you and show you how concrete can be a beautiful and lasting addition to any space!</p>

With the harsh extremes of our Minnesota climate, simply digging a hole and laying block after block shouldn&#8217;t be the only objective when constructing a proper foundation. Soil type, drainage, and other factors require review before beginning a foundation project. If you are adding on to your home but only need a concrete slab poured and shaped to support the addition, we will gladly perform that work as well!</span></span></span></span></span></p>

We have experienced a very wet year, and many folks have had to put up with water seeping (or for some, pouring&#8230;) into their basements or low-lying structures. If that is happening to you, please give us a call. We can assess the situation and install a drain tile system that can eliminate the problem. A dry environment eliminates mold and mildew issues and creates a healthier home for you and your family.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

We offer a full line of repair services and products that can help mend those dilemmas! Give us call and we&#8217;ll be happy to inspect the problem, provide you with the information you need to get the problem fixed, and the products to keep your concrete as good as new.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The great thing about concrete is that it is so accommodating to our needs and adaptable to our environment. Truly malleable when being poured, concrete lends itself to being shaped and formed in a tremendous variety of ways. It can also be colored, stamped, etched, antiqued, and stenciled, and once it has dried provides a durable, low maintenance alternative to almost any other product on the market.</p>
<p>What this really means is, that because concrete is so versatile as a building material, it use is limited only by your imagination. Therefore, as you think about enhancing your property, from interior floors to kitchen counters, and especially when it comes to exterior landscaping, you can allow yourself to dream big.</p>
<p>Throughout the history of humanity, people have used various elements of design to convey some of the values that were most important to them, and to inspire strong feelings on the part of those who viewed or used those structures. When designing for your space, seek inspiration in these many years of amazing human endeavor, choosing the elements that have the most meaning for you.</p>
<p>The ancient Chinese, for example, valued balance and harmony. Many of their buildings are intensely symmetrical in their design. Think of a Chinese pagoda; no one element is out of sync with the other. The ancient Chinese also enjoyed and found peace in flow, and so their gardens are often asymmetrical, but designed to draw you gently and smoothly inside to attain balance and serenity. Using elements of Asian design in your landscaping plans can help you achieve a somewhat exotic yet functional creation.</p>
<p>The Greeks and Romans of old valued strength and order. They built to last, and also to inspire themselves. At the same time, they valued their chances to find small, hidden and unexpected pleasures. Within the grand facades of the Roman Forum a small statue or seating area might be hidden just inside a grove of aspens, their leaves whispering in the breeze. A fountain might deliver its watery music to your ears as you relax nearby.</p>
<p>The Middle East has left a strong mark on the world’s design as well. As former conquerors of Spain, they influenced the Spanish, who, in turn have left their mark here on us in America, especially in the southwest. Middle Eastern builders valued the infinite nature of their deity and used arches and flowing curves to convey this, where it provides a sense of rest and peace, almost like a cool oasis in the scorching desert.</p>
<p>Because it is incredibly flexible as a building material, concrete can be used to invoke any of these, or the countless other, traditions in decoration and design. So, go ahead, imagine your perfect space and dream big! For more great ideas visit us at <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today&#8217;s world it often seems that what we thought was a rock solid choice for a long-term home or business improvement turns out to be something far less in quality and value. Whether it was the result of substandard materials or the wrong solution for a specific application, nothing is more frustrating than to see your desired improvement go from good to bad as fast as the weather can change here in Minnesota.</p>
<p>With that said, there is a product that is highly durable, well suited for our tough Minnesota weather, and rarely disappoints &#8211; concrete! Concrete is extremely hard-wearing and made to last. At Lowell Russell Concrete we work diligently to assist you in designing and creating a finished product that don’t sacrifice attributes such as color, texture and appearance. So forget about all of those preconceived notions you may have about concrete looking sterile, boring, gray all day and &#8220;cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new age of decorative concrete is definitely here, so it’s time to consider the “warmth” and functional exquisiteness that can be produced with concrete! Whether you are considering a countertop for your indoor kitchen or outdoor barbeque, walkways or driveways, foyers or patios, or even outdoor furniture, there is nothing like the durability of concrete. If you like to spend your time outdoors, perhaps you want to consider transforming your current bare-bones patio space into an “outside family room.” Just think of the possibilities for a tranquil outdoor alcove or a fabulous entertainment environment &#8211; a wonderfully crafted fireplace in the corner, a patio surface stained and etched to your artistic desires, and your patio tables and chairs for just a few or a few dozen that are virtually indestructible. With a minimum amount of care and maintenance, these innovative items will remain for generations to enjoy!</p>
<p>If your curiosity is stirred, take a look at some of the pictures in our furniture gallery: <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshogallery/Furniture__4_303.php">http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshogallery/Furniture__4_303.php</a>. You’ll discover some interesting &#8220;concrete&#8221; examples of how exquisite concrete furniture can be! If planning a change to your indoor or outdoor space, consider concrete as a rock solid choice!</p>
