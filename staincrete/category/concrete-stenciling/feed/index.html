										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post is for those who wish to make an impression upon others!</p>
<p>Imprinted concrete, also referred to as stamped, textured or patterned concrete, gives the ability to personalize and enhance your interior and exterior concrete surfaces. You can choose from hundreds of existing patterns or create your own unique design!</p>
<p>Do you have a favorite symbol or emblem, such as Fleur-de-Lis, a trinity knot, or a lotus flower? Or perhaps you wish to create an environment that imitates a specific type of material such as marble, granite, wood or tile? At Russell Lowell Concrete, we can incorporate your preferences into your interior or exterior structural designs.</p>
<p>Here are some general ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mix it up. Choose from several complementary patterns and strategically place them in a repeating or random design on your floors or patio for visual interest.</li>
<li>Give yourself an edge. Decorative patterned edging around walkways and patios can distinguish the common surface areas from your garden and provide a finished look to your exterior structures.</li>
<li>Texturize your surface. Give your floors the appearance of hardwood, your pool the look of a Romanesque pool, your countertops the sophistication of granite, or your fireplace mantel the elegance of marble.</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are few more specific ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a family crest, proudly display it on your front door step.</li>
<li>Take pride in your profession. If you are in the medical profession, incorporate a Caduceus into your design. If you are a mathematician or physicist, perhaps the Infinity symbol appeals to you.</li>
<li>Honor your faith. Integrate an Ichthys, a Celtic Cross or the Star of David into your home structures.</li>
<li>Highlight your hobby. Are you an avid gardener, a sports enthusiast, or lobbyist?  Incorporate your favorite flower, sport or political affiliation into your design.</li>
</ul>
<p>So go on, define your style, and let Lowell Russell Concrete make a lasting impression!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although most people are familiar with concrete structures, such as home  foundations, many don&#8217;t consider the versatility that concrete provides.  The adaptability of concrete allows for many varieties of shapes,  designs, and logos in whatever colors or patterns the customer desires.</p>
<p><span id="more-203"></span>From public plazas to private walkways, swimming pools, and patios, a  unique look can be created by using <a title="concrete stenciling, stamping, or staining" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php">concrete stenciling, stamping, or staining</a> techniques. Either with new or existing concrete, sandblast stenciling  can create medallions, borders, or company logos which can then be  imprinted with highlights and lettering. Brickform blush-tone acid stain  can then be applied to create any color combination desired.</p>
<p>Concrete also has many functional and decorative uses inside a home or  building, such as for room additions, floors, countertops, tables, and  sinks. Indoors, <a title="decorated concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodecorative-concrete.php">decorated concrete</a> can be used to simulate other  materials such as tile, wood, or stone for a unique interior look, such  as enhancing a fireplace.</p>
<p>Customers can supply their own artwork which is camera-ready, or they  can supply their artwork on computer laser prints and disks. This  artwork can then be reproduced in the exact size desired.</p>
<p>If you want to explore the many possibilities of <a title="decorative concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodecorative-concrete.php">decorative concrete</a> for  your home or business, consider contacting <strong>Lowell  Russell Concrete,  Inc.</strong> in Minnesota, at 952-461-3710 or <a title="Request a Quote" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshorequest-a-quote.php">Request a Quote</a> online.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Concrete floors, entryways, patios, and even countertops are the perfect  areas for <a title="decorative concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodecorative-concrete.php">decorative concrete</a>. Whether the home is a brand new one or  decades old, decorative concrete makes it simple to have the desired  look. This is especially true since there are different types available  that appeal to the different tastes that people have. Those types are  <a title="stamped, stenciled, and stained concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php">stamped, stenciled, and stained concrete</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-196"></span> Stamped concrete has a pattern upon it that is imprinted. For  those wishing to have a brick, stone, tile, or even wood appearance  that is affordable, stamped concrete can help achieve that look. It is  possible to choose from a number of popular designs or have one custom  made. This type works well with patios, courtyards, and pool decks.</p>
<p>Stenciled concrete is possible due to what is called decorative sandblast  stenciling. This allows an individual to have any design that they  desire upon their patio, driveway, countertop, or flooring. Landscaping  projects can be completely unique when this technique is used.</p>
<p>Stained concrete is another way to achieve a unique look by  having a translucent effect. A  penetrating acidic stain is applied to the concrete, which is available in a variety of colors.  Through different colors, it is easy to match the color of the home or the décor outside of the home.</p>
<p>Decorative concrete allows for a high class design without the  high class cost. There are so many options available that having a  traditional or contemporary design of virtually any color or style is not a  problem. And any area inside or outside of the home can be decorated in  this way because the concrete will last for many years.</p>

Concrete has traveled a long way from  gray sidewalks and driveways. Just a few examples of what concrete can  be used for are: sleek and durable concrete countertops, innovative  concrete walls resembling any material, and high end polished concrete  floors of any color. Decorative concrete can also give you a custom look  for a driveway,  pool, or patio area. In short, concrete can be stained  any color,  designed to imitate almost any surface, and can be used  virtually  anywhere.</p>
<p><span id="more-189"></span>Concrete has become one of the most sought after materials on the  design market for its versatility and many other good reasons. It is  less expensive than other design materials, more durable, virtually maintenance  free, and environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>One popular option is <a title="stamped concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php#stamp">stamped concrete</a>, this is typically used for  outdoor projects and the concrete can be dyed any color or combination  of colors. The concrete is stamped when it is wet to give it the look of  stone or brick. You can get the same look for half the price of  traditional materials. Just a few of the design options are custom  walkways, stairs, and retaining walls.</p>
<p>Concrete can also be polished,  and when polished it is typically used for maintenance free flooring that  will never need to be refinished or waxed! While polished floors have  mainly been used for businesses, homeowners are turning to this solution  for a custom floor that is a beautiful focal point of their home.</p>
<p>If  you have existing concrete that you do not want to replace but you do  want it to be more decorative, concrete can also be engraved. An  experienced <a title="decorative concrete installer" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php">decorative concrete installer</a> can use tools to etch designs  into the concrete. The etching can be done alone or accompanied by  staining, which can be done in any hue. Contact an experienced  decorative concrete installer today, save money, and make your design  dreams come true!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[For customers in the market for <a title="countertops" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshocountertops.php">countertops</a>, there's no better option than concrete.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For customers in the market for <a title="countertops" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshocountertops.php">countertops</a>, there&#8217;s no better option than concrete. Concrete seamlessly combines durability with elegant simplicity and provides countless options for design.</p>
<p><span id="more-182"></span>In addition to durability, concrete is also a sustainable, green product. Concrete contains varying combinations of natural resources, like ash, gravel, limestone, and sand—which are abundantly available locally. Using regionally produced raw materials helps to keep the carbon footprint small, and also keeps the cost lower than other materials such as granite, which would need to be shipped from another part of the country.</p>
<p>Concrete counters are handcrafted; this allows the customer to choose from numerous options to design just the right countertop for their home or business. Because the concrete is cast in molds, the customer can request unique shaping for added interest. A drainboard can be integrated into the countertop to facilitate food production. Or an integrated sink can be made from the concrete, for an efficient, streamlined appearance.</p>
<p>Many techniques are available to add patterns, color, and/or texture to concrete countertops. Staining involves the use of chemicals to create a colored or textured appearance, allowing the counter to mimic the look of tile, wood, or stone. Stenciling is done by using a sandblasting technique to create borders, logos, and original artwork. Embedding is a process by which coins, glass, fossils, stones, or other desired items are added to the counter to create a unique, customized appearance. And concrete countertops can be polished to add an elegant, high-gloss finish.</p>
<p>At Lowell Russell, we are dedicated to excellence in workmanship and customer satisfaction, and we use cutting-edge techniques and equipment to give our customers the counters they deserve.</p>
<p>If you want to investigate the many possibilities of <a title="concrete countertops" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshocountertops.php">concrete countertops</a> for your home or business, consider contacting <strong>Lowell Russell Concrete, Inc.</strong> in Minnesota, at 952-461-3710 or <a title="Request a Quote" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshorequest-a-quote.php">Request a Quote</a> online.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Using the flexible modern design possibilities of old-fashioned concrete is one of the most innovative modern construction techniques. Today&#8217;s <a title="decorative concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshodecorative-concrete.php">decorative concrete</a> technology can produce results that are at once amazingly beautiful, completely practical and surprisingly inexpensive.</p>
<p><span id="more-173"></span>Home and business owners are no longer limited to the familiar dull gray &#8220;concrete&#8221; look, because <a title="concrete can be stained" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php#staining">concrete can be stained</a> in a variety of durable and attractive colors and finishes. Decorative concrete mimics the appearance of costly tile, marble or granite, as well as slate and even wood.</p>
<p>Colors can be chosen to match the color scheme of a home, and geometric patterns can be <a title="stamped into the concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php#stamp">stamped into the concrete</a>. Designs can <a title="stenciled on concrete" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php#constencil">stenciled on concrete</a>, lending a designer touch to an otherwise utilitarian product. And glass embedded in the concrete during construction yields an interesting effect. Applying a high polish to the concrete will give the same mirror finish as marble or granite.</p>
<p>Decorative concrete is a handsome and long-lasting choice for the new driveway, sidewalk, patio, pool deck or entryway. Consider impressing either natural or geometric designs on a fireplace mantel or surround.</p>
<p>Countertops designed of stamped or colored decorative concrete are useful in the kitchen, bathroom or bar, but are especially popular for use on patios. Weather resistant for years, decorative concrete will create a stunning patio counter and can color coordinate with the surface of the patio. Concrete patio furniture has become increasingly popular in recent years. Maintenance of the concrete patio is a breeze, requiring occasional washing and resealing every few years.</p>
