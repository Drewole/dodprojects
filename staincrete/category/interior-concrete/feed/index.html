										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Concrete Staining in Minnesota by Lowell Russell Concrete</h2>
<p>Unique and beautiful floors are growing in popularity, and many who are building new or remodeling are looking to stained concrete floors as an alternative to carpet, tile, and wood. Plain concrete floors can become jaw-dropping beautiful with the acid stain coloring process.</p>
<h3><a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/lowell-russell-concrete.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-364" alt="minnesota concrete staining" src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/lowell-russell-concrete.jpg" width="350" height="251" /></a></h3>
<p>Acid staining is a coloring process involving a chemical reaction of water, acid, and inorganic salts. These materials react with minerals already present in the concrete (calcium hydroxide) and provide color. Acid staining can be applied to new or old, plain or already colored concrete surfaces, and typically gives concrete a mottled, variegated, marble-like look. However, you may get different reactions from slab to slab. You may even see different color patterns on the same slab of concrete. The random mix of color tones and shades is what gives an acid stained floor its unique beauty, radiance, vintage or antique look.</p>
<p>Millions of feet of acid staining are done each year. Because of the many benefits, decorative concrete is flourishing and seems to be here to stay. One of the many benefits of acid staining concrete is that the finish will not fade or chip. With templates and decorative patterns, acid staining certainly enhances the look of your floor, whether residential or commercial, and many people are looking to go the route of acid staining as an alternative to the typical carpet and tile floors. This form of floor treatment can give new life to old concrete and give it the look of a luxurious granite or deep marble.</p>
<p>Floors are not the only part of your home that can be acid-stained. Exteriors, walls, and other concrete surfaces can also be decorated or colored using concrete acid stain. Concrete blocks, for example, can be decorated or colored before installation on the outside of your home. A concrete staircase, patio, or trim around doors and windows are other options to give your home a welcoming look and feel and will transform your everyday boring look into the beautiful, luxurious home you have always dreamed of owning.</p>
<p>If enhancing your floors, walls, or exterior of your home with acid stained concrete has been on your list of things to do, please give <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a> a call. You can browse through our photo gallery of interior projects for ideas.  It is never too early to begin the plans for a new project to upgrade both your home’s value and appearance.  Contact us today to speak with one of our trained professionals.</p>

A fireplace can give your home an inviting and comfy feeling and typically brings to mind relaxed nights spent with loved ones in front of a blazing hearth.</p>
<p>For hundreds of years a fireplace was a masonry box constructed of mortar and brick or stone where wood was burned for warmth. Thanks to the demands for energy conservation this simplistic concept has changed over the past few decades. Dedicated architecture and energy efficient designs create a dedicated space to burn anything from wood to gas. Some fireplaces house an electric heating device, while others don&#8217;t provide any heat at all and merely serve as a decorative construct with a beautiful mantel for displays, knick-knacks, or heirlooms.</p>
<p>If you purchased a home with an older fireplace, now may be the perfect time for a fireplace facelift. Lightweight stones can add rustic charm to any hearth, or a Victorian style mantle in marble or slate could be just the look you wish to achieve. With varieties of fireplace and mantle designs too numerous to count, you can choose the look that is perfect for your home. Carved limestone, marble, flat stones, rounded boulders, or coarse volcanic rock can be chosen to match the color scheme and feel of your home. Different designs such as colonial, contemporary, rustic, log cabin, modern, or old world are just a few choices. And it is not only the type of stone that you choose, but the color, shape and design of your fireplace and mantel that will create the final work of art.</p>
<p>If giving your fireplace a facelift is something you have been putting off for years and you are considering a timeless look that will warm up your future holiday gatherings, now may be the time to tackle the fireplace facelift.  Please give <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a> a call. You can browse through our photo gallery of fireplaces for ideas and inspiration. It is never too early to begin the plans for a new project to upgrade both your home’s value and appearance.

<p>Becoming the new material of choice, many designers and homeowners are selecting <strong>concrete floors</strong> for their residences and businesses. Stained, painted, colored, and personalized floors are showing up in homes, offices, restaurants and, often times retail stores, malls, and schools. <strong>Stained concrete floors</strong> offer many options for interior rooms with limitless colors and designs. And flooring is not the only place you may see this lovely material. Countertops, patio tables, bathrooms, and pool areas have also become common places for <strong>decorative concrete</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/decorative-concrete-lowell-russell-concrete.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-356" alt="decorative concrete lowell russell concrete" src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoblog/wp-content/uploads/decorative-concrete-lowell-russell-concrete.jpg" width="350" height="262" /></a>Concrete is a popular material because it enhances the integrity of the architect’s designs and is easy to maintain. Floor designs do not have to have the industrial look when concrete is chosen for your flooring material. It can be designed in any way, is durable, and can be easily changed if needed. It can be designed in a unique way so that it naturally blends in with other elements of your room, and many times you may not even realize you are standing on a concrete floor! It doesn’t have to be gray and boring! Concrete floors can be colored, have textures applied, include patterns, or even monogrammed. Spice it up with stencils and paint. Polished concrete is beautifully smooth and often mistaken for marble. The sleek look makes it a versatile choice in a number of settings. Many individuals may think that the surface of polished concrete may become slippery when wet (such as in pool areas or bathrooms). However, for added slip protection, there are special anti-slip conditioners to make the concrete safe and improves traction when wet.</p>
<p>Concrete floors, countertops, and tables are gaining popularity in the design world because of its capability to be designed any way you choose. It can offer customization, functionality and extreme durability for kitchen floors and withstand elements that kitchen floors are routinely exposed to including foot traffic, food spills, dropping of utensils, etc. No other surface can resist chipping, staining or discoloring like a concrete floor or countertop!</p>
<p>With the winter season upon us, take these free weekends and spend your indoor time considering how you would like to upgrade your flooring. Don’t let the winter blues get you down! Take this time to browse our photo gallery of interior designs and let your dreams become a reality with a new look through polished, stained, or painted concrete. You won’t regret it! Give us a call today and let <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a> create and spice-up your home flooring or counter top needs!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While deciding which type of countertop to install in your new kitchen, you were faced with a multitude of choices, including, but not limited to, granite, wood, stainless steel, tile or concrete. You finally decided to have concrete countertops designed and installed because of their durability, beauty and the numerous options you were given for stain color and texture.</p>
<p>Now, you’re enjoying your customized concrete countertops and you want to keep them looking beautiful for years to come. After all, your new countertops aren’t just conventional countertops, they’re unique works-of-art that help draw friends and family to the warmth and comfort of your kitchen.</p>
<p>To help maintain the beauty and character of your concrete countertops, keep these simple care tips in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow the instructions you were given by your concrete contractor regarding periodic re-sealing.</li>
<li>Clean them daily with warm water and a mild non-abrasive soap on a dish cloth or sponge. Cleaning agents containing bleach, ammonia or vinegar should always be avoided.</li>
<li>Quickly wipe off spills from your countertops as soon as they occur. Keep in mind that some liquids, such as wine, grape or prune juice or oil, can stain concrete surfaces. Other types of liquid, including citrus juices, such as lemon or lime juice, and vinegar, can create light spots and etch concrete.</li>
<li>Don’t cut on your countertops. Use cutting boards when chopping and preparing foods. Cutting won’t hurt them, but it could damage the sealer, which helps keep out water and stains.</li>
<li>Avoid placing hot pots, pans or baking sheets on concrete countertops. While concrete is heat resistant, it could damage or discolor the sealer.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on caring for your concrete countertops or to add their style and functionality to your living space, contact the professionals at <a title="Lowell Russell Concrete of Minnesota" href="https://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The great thing about concrete is that it is so accommodating to our needs and adaptable to our environment. Truly malleable when being poured, concrete lends itself to being shaped and formed in a tremendous variety of ways. It can also be colored, stamped, etched, antiqued, and stenciled, and once it has dried provides a durable, low maintenance alternative to almost any other product on the market.</p>
<p>What this really means is, that because concrete is so versatile as a building material, it use is limited only by your imagination. Therefore, as you think about enhancing your property, from interior floors to kitchen counters, and especially when it comes to exterior landscaping, you can allow yourself to dream big.</p>
<p>Throughout the history of humanity, people have used various elements of design to convey some of the values that were most important to them, and to inspire strong feelings on the part of those who viewed or used those structures. When designing for your space, seek inspiration in these many years of amazing human endeavor, choosing the elements that have the most meaning for you.</p>
<p>The ancient Chinese, for example, valued balance and harmony. Many of their buildings are intensely symmetrical in their design. Think of a Chinese pagoda; no one element is out of sync with the other. The ancient Chinese also enjoyed and found peace in flow, and so their gardens are often asymmetrical, but designed to draw you gently and smoothly inside to attain balance and serenity. Using elements of Asian design in your landscaping plans can help you achieve a somewhat exotic yet functional creation.</p>
<p>The Greeks and Romans of old valued strength and order. They built to last, and also to inspire themselves. At the same time, they valued their chances to find small, hidden and unexpected pleasures. Within the grand facades of the Roman Forum a small statue or seating area might be hidden just inside a grove of aspens, their leaves whispering in the breeze. A fountain might deliver its watery music to your ears as you relax nearby.</p>
<p>The Middle East has left a strong mark on the world’s design as well. As former conquerors of Spain, they influenced the Spanish, who, in turn have left their mark here on us in America, especially in the southwest. Middle Eastern builders valued the infinite nature of their deity and used arches and flowing curves to convey this, where it provides a sense of rest and peace, almost like a cool oasis in the scorching desert.</p>
<p>Because it is incredibly flexible as a building material, concrete can be used to invoke any of these, or the countless other, traditions in decoration and design. So, go ahead, imagine your perfect space and dream big! For more great ideas visit us at <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s pretty easy to think of things that don&#8217;t improve with age like milk or any other type of highly perishable product. Although your new car isn&#8217;t considered a perishable, the moment you drive it off the sales lot, its value perishes and doesn&#8217;t improve with age! Ouch!</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are a lot of things that do improve with age; friends, wine, and concrete are great examples. Wait&#8230;did we say concrete?  Absolutely! Unlike perishable products and materials that perish in value with age, items created with concrete are built to last. Probably the most famous example of concrete construction is the Roman Coliseum. Obviously lacking in the grandeur it once held, one must take into account the Coliseum has withstood thousands of years of weather, earthquakes, and random ransacking. There are other substantial concrete notables which include Australia&#8217;s famous Sydney Opera House and the Falling Waters house designed and built by Frank Lloyd Wright.</p>
<p>A little closer to home, however, are patios and pool-sides, garden boarders, outdoor furniture and landscaping elements. These are great areas in which to take advantage of the durability of concrete. Plastic lawn furniture starts to degrade the minute you put it under the hot summer sun. Wood will last longer than plastic, but requires constant care and attention such as cleaning, resurfacing and restaining. But concrete lasts. A concrete patio is highly durable and can be fashioned with a multitude of color and design combinations. Compared to other outdoor surfaces, concrete requires far less maintenance and will add value to a property for many years.</p>
<p>In recent years, designers, architects and sculptors have rediscovered an artistic truth; concrete is an artistic medium just as much as it is a building material because it can be stained, etched, colored, stenciled and shaped in an almost infinite variety of ways.  Concrete fixtures can lend your home the classical dignity of a Roman villa or the exotic charm of the new age, and everything in between!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve been following our blog, you&#8217;re probably saying &#8220;Okay, I get it! <b><i>Concrete is art. </i></b>I now know that concrete is NOT just something to walk or drive on, that it goes way beyond parking garages and city sidewalks and can be used for kitchen floors, countertops, pool area patios, decorative driveways and front steps. I can use concrete to realize my visions for a new mantel piece, nightstand, or outdoor dining area. What else is there to know about concrete?&#8221; Well, you might be surprised!</p>
<p>While reading along you may have found yourself repeating our marvelous mixed material mantra: &#8220;Concrete is FLEXIBLE.&#8221; And it is &#8211; concrete can be poured in a variety of styles and shapes and stained in an almost endless palette of colors. In fact, not only can it can be stained, it can be stamped and stenciled, offering the home or business owner an almost unlimited number of choices and creative combinations. Even custom work is possible. For example, a business owner can have their company’s logo colorfully stamped into the floor of the building’s entryway or as a vibrant multicolored backdrop behind the reception area.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve also learned that concrete structures are built to last and are easy to clean and care for. Exterior concrete designs and structures need to be sealed only once every few years, and that sure beats the annual cleaning and staining a wooden deck requires!</p>
<p>Yes, if you&#8217;ve been reading along, you know all this, so here&#8217;s something <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NEW</span></b> to try &#8211; instead of just <i>reading</i> about how versatile concrete is, why not try doing a bit of design experimenting on your own? Follow this link to our CONCRETE DESIGNER at <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoconcrete-designer.php">http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoconcrete-designer.php</a>. where you can choose to experiment with either INTERIOR or EXTEROR designs.

<p>Once you&#8217;re there, follow the instructions and have fun! Get creative with designs for driveways, patios, pool areas, or different interior floors. Choose from different patterns, edging treatments, and colors. It’s a lot of fun and remember, these are only a few of the possible combinations that you can put together to make your home look extraordinary!</p>
