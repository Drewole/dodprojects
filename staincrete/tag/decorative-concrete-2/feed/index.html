										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Does the words “creative” and “concrete” seem counter-intuitive and paradoxical when used in the same sentence? If they do, please read on!</p>
<p>First, make a list of all of the ways concrete can be used. Did you come up with highways, driveways, sidewalks and stairs? In other words, did you come up with surfaces you can drive or walk on? These are all common uses of concrete, the importance of which should not be underestimated. After all, who wants to walk on a muddy pathway or drive across a rickety bridge made out of planks?</p>
<p>Now, think of concrete surfaces that you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cannot</span> drive or walk on. Can’t think of anything? Okay, how about surfaces you can place things on, like countertops, tables and shelves. These didn&#8217;t come to mind either? They should, because there are so many more uses for concrete than what many people ever thought possible!</p>
<p>Envision a kitchen countertop crafted out of concrete that looks like granite or tile, but doesn’t chip or crack. Imagine your next board meeting held around a concrete conference table that appears to be crafted of beautifully polished wood. The perfect match of durability and elegance that is naturally impervious to the stains, blemishes and discoloration that would ruin a wood table! Think of a marble fireplace mantel, leather-topped end tables or solid oak decorative shelving &#8211; all made out of concrete!</p>
<p>The uses of concrete are infinite, and Lowell Russell Concrete strives to create the most functional designs and creations imaginable. Factor in color, custom design, texturing and imprinting and you have a lasting and personalized piece of artwork.</p>
<p>Lowell Russell Concrete can create a unique piece or interior theme for you through our innovative and scientific use of concrete staining, personalized imprinting, decorative framing and edgework. We can design and create an application specifically to fit your needs, or take your design and craft the item or construct the space you desire.</p>
<p>When you think “concrete,” think outside of the box..think Lowell Russell Concrete!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Lowell Russell Concrete we&#8217;re always dreaming in color, especially when it comes to decorative concrete, and we can make our dreams your reality!</p>
<p>No longer does concrete need to be displayed in drab and humdrum variations of gray, light gray and dark gray. With 24 primary colors to choose from, and countless color combinations of each, Lowell Russell Concrete can bring vibrant colors and beauty into your home through custom stained concrete. Stains can also be applied to resemble other surfaces and materials, such as natural stone, tile, marble, wood, or even leather.</p>
<p>Close your eyes&#8230;visualize the concrete around your pool as festive mosaic tiles, your fireplace mantle as stunning polished marble, your floors a richly textured hardwood, or your countertops to look like solid gleaming granite. We can quickly and easily help you achieve these appearances both inside your home and surrounding property.</p>
<p>You may ask, why imitate a substance when you could simply use actual tile, marble or wood? The answer is quite simple; concrete lasts longer while achieving the same effect. And, even better, if the concrete is already in place, you don’t have to go to the trouble and expense to rip it out and replace it with a different material.</p>
<p>How does staining work? Lowell and Russell Concrete uses a process called “Chemstaining,&#8221; which is an acidic stain that chemically reacts with cured concrete. This process can be applied to newly poured or existing concrete, and through this method, permanent, variegated or translucent effects can be fashioned into your interior and exterior concrete structures.</p>
<p>How long does the color last? Unlike a painted surface, stained concrete will hold the color as long as the concrete itself lasts, won’t fade as quickly when exposed to sunlight, or require constant maintenance and repainting as the years go by.</p>
<p>Give you home a facelift! If you want to refresh the look of your home today without completely remodeling your surfaces, give us a call.
