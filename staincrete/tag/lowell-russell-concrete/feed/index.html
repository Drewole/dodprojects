										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today&#8217;s world it often seems that what we thought was a rock solid choice for a long-term home or business improvement turns out to be something far less in quality and value. Whether it was the result of substandard materials or the wrong solution for a specific application, nothing is more frustrating than to see your desired improvement go from good to bad as fast as the weather can change here in Minnesota.</p>
<p>With that said, there is a product that is highly durable, well suited for our tough Minnesota weather, and rarely disappoints &#8211; concrete! Concrete is extremely hard-wearing and made to last. At Lowell Russell Concrete we work diligently to assist you in designing and creating a finished product that don’t sacrifice attributes such as color, texture and appearance. So forget about all of those preconceived notions you may have about concrete looking sterile, boring, gray all day and &#8220;cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new age of decorative concrete is definitely here, so it’s time to consider the “warmth” and functional exquisiteness that can be produced with concrete! Whether you are considering a countertop for your indoor kitchen or outdoor barbeque, walkways or driveways, foyers or patios, or even outdoor furniture, there is nothing like the durability of concrete. If you like to spend your time outdoors, perhaps you want to consider transforming your current bare-bones patio space into an “outside family room.” Just think of the possibilities for a tranquil outdoor alcove or a fabulous entertainment environment &#8211; a wonderfully crafted fireplace in the corner, a patio surface stained and etched to your artistic desires, and your patio tables and chairs for just a few or a few dozen that are virtually indestructible. With a minimum amount of care and maintenance, these innovative items will remain for generations to enjoy!</p>
<p>If your curiosity is stirred, take a look at some of the pictures in our furniture gallery: <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshogallery/Furniture__4_303.php">http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshogallery/Furniture__4_303.php</a>. You’ll discover some interesting &#8220;concrete&#8221; examples of how exquisite concrete furniture can be! If planning a change to your indoor or outdoor space, consider concrete as a rock solid choice!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wait…wait…yes…it’s coming…it’s bubbling up…impossible to stop…here IT COMES….</p>
<p align="center"><strong>YIPPEEEE!   SPRING IS HERE!!!</strong></p>
<p>Okay, sorry about that, but it’s just that time. Sure, it may be a while before it starts to LOOK like spring, but it is here &#8211; the snow is finally melting away, the sun is warmer and higher in the sky, the birds are making their way home from Mexico, and, in just a few weeks, they’ll be building new nests and sprucing the place up.</p>
<p>Most people feel that way too. As the snow melts and slowly reveals that old and worn patio, we start getting ideas like “Wouldn’t it be GREAT if we had a new patio?“ Or “Hey, I know! A Pool!” Or maybe your dreams are continually dashed by the dreaded reality “Darn it, every year when the snow melts I keep hoping those ugly front steps will be gone, but every year they’re still there…guess I’ll have to do something myself!”</p>
<p>There are a lot of fun things to build this summer, and it’s time to start planning. Lowell Russell Concrete would love to help you replace your worn and outdated patio area or steps with one of our many unique, colorful and exceptionally functional designs.</p>
<p>If you are in a practical mood, it might be the year to think about a new driveway or front walkway. After all, these are the first areas that both you and your visitors see when arriving at your house. If you’ve read our blog before, you know that we can stamp, mold, or etch concrete in a wide variety of patterns in an array of colors sure to fit and personalize your outdoor environment.</p>
<p>But if your thoughts are running more toward the back yard, we can help you do a LOT out there as well! Patios, seating areas, pools, outdoor fireplaces, decorative walkways&#8230;the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Here’s an idea; go take a look at some of the different pictures on our <a title="Lowell Russell Concrete Gallery of Photos" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshogallery/pools_8.php">site</a> and then let your imagination go to work to create an outdoor environment that will compliment your home and life style. And don’t worry about the &#8220;what ifs?&#8221; because the great thing about concrete is if you can dream it, we can probably create it!  So have fun…it’s Spring!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Lowell Russell Concrete, our passion lies in designing timeless custom interior and exterior concrete structures for our customers. We are a family-owned business based in Minnesota and have over 35 years of experience in the concrete industry.</p>
<p>We have been continually recognized by the Better Business Bureau and Angie’s List for our excellence in customer service, and we intend to continue that tradition in the years to come.</p>
<p>We have designed numerous interior and exterior structures for our community and neighbors that range from the unique to the extraordinary, and we use only the highest quality materials and latest proven technology in our concrete mix, stains, impressions, custom art reproduction and stenciling.</p>
<p>We offer an extensive variety of concrete products, ranging from exterior surfaces such as driveways, walkways, patios and pools, to interior surfaces such as countertops, floors, and, yes, even furniture!</p>
<p>With 24 primary color stains or any combination of each, you can choose from a full color palate to obtain the exact color(s) you wish to achieve. Our Chemstaining process ensures that the color will last as long as your concrete, and will not fade or discolor with time or exposure to the elements.</p>
<p>Our design department can make your dream a reality by incorporating your custom artwork into the finished product. Bring us your artwork, a symbol, an emblem, a company name or logo and we can make it happen! We can even work from old photos, computer-generated images, or a picture drawn on a napkin!</p>
<p>We believe in the use of stamped and texturized impressions versus rolled impressions, as our method penetrates deep into the concrete surface to leave a lasting impression of your design. We can make your surface appear to be made of wood, marble, tile and even leather – all with the added concrete benefits of strength and durability!</p>
<p>Your finished product will stand the test of time with beauty and grace. For custom work performed by proven experts in your area, trust your concrete needs to Lowell Russell Concrete. We guarantee you will be satisfied with the results!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post is for those who wish to make an impression upon others!</p>
<p>Imprinted concrete, also referred to as stamped, textured or patterned concrete, gives the ability to personalize and enhance your interior and exterior concrete surfaces. You can choose from hundreds of existing patterns or create your own unique design!</p>
<p>Do you have a favorite symbol or emblem, such as Fleur-de-Lis, a trinity knot, or a lotus flower? Or perhaps you wish to create an environment that imitates a specific type of material such as marble, granite, wood or tile? At Russell Lowell Concrete, we can incorporate your preferences into your interior or exterior structural designs.</p>
<p>Here are some general ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mix it up. Choose from several complementary patterns and strategically place them in a repeating or random design on your floors or patio for visual interest.</li>
<li>Give yourself an edge. Decorative patterned edging around walkways and patios can distinguish the common surface areas from your garden and provide a finished look to your exterior structures.</li>
<li>Texturize your surface. Give your floors the appearance of hardwood, your pool the look of a Romanesque pool, your countertops the sophistication of granite, or your fireplace mantel the elegance of marble.</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are few more specific ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a family crest, proudly display it on your front door step.</li>
<li>Take pride in your profession. If you are in the medical profession, incorporate a Caduceus into your design. If you are a mathematician or physicist, perhaps the Infinity symbol appeals to you.</li>
<li>Honor your faith. Integrate an Ichthys, a Celtic Cross or the Star of David into your home structures.</li>
<li>Highlight your hobby. Are you an avid gardener, a sports enthusiast, or lobbyist?  Incorporate your favorite flower, sport or political affiliation into your design.</li>
</ul>
<p>So go on, define your style, and let Lowell Russell Concrete make a lasting impression!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are three main ingredients to a successful backyard BBQ – friends, food and ambiance. We can’t help you with the friends or the food (although we would certainly appreciate an invitation!), but we can help you with the ambiance. In fact, even if you have just a few friends over or the hot dogs get a bit burned, you can still leave your guests with a favorable impression that will keep them talking for weeks to come.</p>
<p>It all comes down to the beautiful presentation that can be created in your outdoor environment by using decorative concrete. Think walkways and patios; one attractively leads the way to your event and the other brilliantly showcases it.</p>
<p>Walkways</p>
<p>Pave your path to success. One of the first things your guests will see is the walkway leading to your party. Make it memorable! By using textured or imprinted concrete you can create the illusion of stone, while adding edging along the sides can give it a distinctive look. Design the walkway to  wind and meander through your gardens to highlight your flowing garden blooms from the best angles, and as the walkway nears your patio consider adding color to make it &#8220;pop&#8221; to set the stage for your main event.</p>
<p>Patios</p>
<p>Create a focal point for your party by designing an open, airy space to welcome and comfort friends and family. A conversation pit or a fireplace will draw your guests to the center to socialize. A graduated-level patio invites folks to stroll about and provides them with various viewpoints of the yard. If space allows, combine of all three!</p>
<p>Using textured or imprinted concrete on your patio will further add to the feeling you would like to achieve; a rustic feel through a wooden texture, a modern look with smooth geometrical shapes, a poolside ambience with mosaic tile, or a personalized flair with a custom pattern.</p>
<p>Between creating the guest list and planning the menu, you’re going to be busy, and probably a little stressed. Lowell Russell Concrete is here to give you one less thing to worry about by designing and constructing the outdoor environment you dream of!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Does the words “creative” and “concrete” seem counter-intuitive and paradoxical when used in the same sentence? If they do, please read on!</p>
<p>First, make a list of all of the ways concrete can be used. Did you come up with highways, driveways, sidewalks and stairs? In other words, did you come up with surfaces you can drive or walk on? These are all common uses of concrete, the importance of which should not be underestimated. After all, who wants to walk on a muddy pathway or drive across a rickety bridge made out of planks?</p>
<p>Now, think of concrete surfaces that you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cannot</span> drive or walk on. Can’t think of anything? Okay, how about surfaces you can place things on, like countertops, tables and shelves. These didn&#8217;t come to mind either? They should, because there are so many more uses for concrete than what many people ever thought possible!</p>
<p>Envision a kitchen countertop crafted out of concrete that looks like granite or tile, but doesn’t chip or crack. Imagine your next board meeting held around a concrete conference table that appears to be crafted of beautifully polished wood. The perfect match of durability and elegance that is naturally impervious to the stains, blemishes and discoloration that would ruin a wood table! Think of a marble fireplace mantel, leather-topped end tables or solid oak decorative shelving &#8211; all made out of concrete!</p>
<p>The uses of concrete are infinite, and Lowell Russell Concrete strives to create the most functional designs and creations imaginable. Factor in color, custom design, texturing and imprinting and you have a lasting and personalized piece of artwork.</p>
<p>Lowell Russell Concrete can create a unique piece or interior theme for you through our innovative and scientific use of concrete staining, personalized imprinting, decorative framing and edgework. We can design and create an application specifically to fit your needs, or take your design and craft the item or construct the space you desire.</p>
<p>When you think “concrete,” think outside of the box..think Lowell Russell Concrete!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Attain a sense of elegance for your home without compromising on your consumer savvy.  Stained concrete paves the way to unexpected and affordable style.  With stained concrete you can enjoy the beauty of natural stone without paying the price.</p>
<p>If you are remodeling an existing home, in any outdoor or indoor living space, give stained concrete a try.  It can be difficult to find just the right natural stone, ceramic or laminate tile, countertop or table to go with the other design elements in a home when remodeling.  Hours can be spent looking and searching for just the right one and sometimes, just the right tile, countertop or table can’t be found; or, if it can be found, the price makes it more of a sacrifice than it should be.  In design conundrums like these, stained concrete saves the day.</p>
<p>Concrete can mold itself to any shape.  Stained concrete is available in an array of colors and shades.  Concrete can be stenciled, stamped, stained, etched and more.  There is an unlimited amount of ways concrete can be designed and utilized.  From where your welcome mat lies outside your door to your kitchen counter, from your bedroom night stand to your outdoor entertainment space, concrete paves the way for today’s stylish consumers.  No other material is as flexible in style, form or function.</p>
<p>Before looking at other options, sifting through catalogs to fine just the right thing only to find out that it is price exclusive, start your search with stained concrete.  Since you can create whatever look you want with it, you’ll avoid the hassle of running from store to store and searching stacks of magazines for the idea you have, that you know would be just right, if only somebody made it.</p>
<p>Your concrete design expert can create whatever design you can imagine.  If you need to see some options to get you started, your concrete design expert can offer that as well. For service that meets your needs, wherever you are at in your remodeling process and material that is able to do the same, <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshorequest-a-quote.php">contact us for a free quote</a>. We offer a variety of concrete services, including interior and exterior applications, staining, stenciling and imprinting of concrete.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is continuity when it comes to design? Continuity is an essential element which encompasses all the aspects of design and function including working from the same color palette throughout a home or place of business. Why is it important? It creates a sense of flow that gives you, your family members and guests a sense of ease and comfort. At Lowell Russell Concrete, our design capabilities and craftsmanship are ideally suited to creating a visual and functional sense of continuity at an affordable and highly competitive price.</p>
<p>Imagine using stained concrete for your driveway and/or walkway and then using the same color of concrete for your countertop. You might want to utilize stamped concrete for your outdoor projects while using smooth concrete for the countertops.  Or, if you’ve always wanted a tiled countertop, concrete can be textured and colored do that too!</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve always wanted an outdoor kitchen, pool or gathering space. Create it with concrete! It’s another opportunity to tie design themes together inside and outside of your home. Create a dramatic color contrast between your indoor and outdoor living areas or design the passages between the indoor and outdoor spaces with subtle color changes to produce distinctive environments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Lowell Russell Concrete we&#8217;re always dreaming in color, especially when it comes to decorative concrete, and we can make our dreams your reality!</p>
<p>No longer does concrete need to be displayed in drab and humdrum variations of gray, light gray and dark gray. With 24 primary colors to choose from, and countless color combinations of each, Lowell Russell Concrete can bring vibrant colors and beauty into your home through custom stained concrete. Stains can also be applied to resemble other surfaces and materials, such as natural stone, tile, marble, wood, or even leather.</p>
<p>Close your eyes&#8230;visualize the concrete around your pool as festive mosaic tiles, your fireplace mantle as stunning polished marble, your floors a richly textured hardwood, or your countertops to look like solid gleaming granite. We can quickly and easily help you achieve these appearances both inside your home and surrounding property.</p>
<p>You may ask, why imitate a substance when you could simply use actual tile, marble or wood? The answer is quite simple; concrete lasts longer while achieving the same effect. And, even better, if the concrete is already in place, you don’t have to go to the trouble and expense to rip it out and replace it with a different material.</p>
<p>How does staining work? Lowell and Russell Concrete uses a process called “Chemstaining,&#8221; which is an acidic stain that chemically reacts with cured concrete. This process can be applied to newly poured or existing concrete, and through this method, permanent, variegated or translucent effects can be fashioned into your interior and exterior concrete structures.</p>
<p>How long does the color last? Unlike a painted surface, stained concrete will hold the color as long as the concrete itself lasts, won’t fade as quickly when exposed to sunlight, or require constant maintenance and repainting as the years go by.</p>
<p>Give you home a facelift! If you want to refresh the look of your home today without completely remodeling your surfaces, give us a call.
