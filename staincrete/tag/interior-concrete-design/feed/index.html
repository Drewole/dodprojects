										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Attain a sense of elegance for your home without compromising on your consumer savvy.  Stained concrete paves the way to unexpected and affordable style.  With stained concrete you can enjoy the beauty of natural stone without paying the price.</p>
<p>If you are remodeling an existing home, in any outdoor or indoor living space, give stained concrete a try.  It can be difficult to find just the right natural stone, ceramic or laminate tile, countertop or table to go with the other design elements in a home when remodeling.  Hours can be spent looking and searching for just the right one and sometimes, just the right tile, countertop or table can’t be found; or, if it can be found, the price makes it more of a sacrifice than it should be.  In design conundrums like these, stained concrete saves the day.</p>
<p>Concrete can mold itself to any shape.  Stained concrete is available in an array of colors and shades.  Concrete can be stenciled, stamped, stained, etched and more.  There is an unlimited amount of ways concrete can be designed and utilized.  From where your welcome mat lies outside your door to your kitchen counter, from your bedroom night stand to your outdoor entertainment space, concrete paves the way for today’s stylish consumers.  No other material is as flexible in style, form or function.</p>
<p>Before looking at other options, sifting through catalogs to fine just the right thing only to find out that it is price exclusive, start your search with stained concrete.  Since you can create whatever look you want with it, you’ll avoid the hassle of running from store to store and searching stacks of magazines for the idea you have, that you know would be just right, if only somebody made it.</p>
<p>Your concrete design expert can create whatever design you can imagine.  If you need to see some options to get you started, your concrete design expert can offer that as well.
