										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Lowell Russell Concrete, our passion lies in designing timeless custom interior and exterior concrete structures for our customers. We are a family-owned business based in Minnesota and have over 35 years of experience in the concrete industry.</p>
<p>We have been continually recognized by the Better Business Bureau and Angie’s List for our excellence in customer service, and we intend to continue that tradition in the years to come.</p>
<p>We have designed numerous interior and exterior structures for our community and neighbors that range from the unique to the extraordinary, and we use only the highest quality materials and latest proven technology in our concrete mix, stains, impressions, custom art reproduction and stenciling.</p>
<p>We offer an extensive variety of concrete products, ranging from exterior surfaces such as driveways, walkways, patios and pools, to interior surfaces such as countertops, floors, and, yes, even furniture!</p>
<p>With 24 primary color stains or any combination of each, you can choose from a full color palate to obtain the exact color(s) you wish to achieve. Our Chemstaining process ensures that the color will last as long as your concrete, and will not fade or discolor with time or exposure to the elements.</p>
<p>Our design department can make your dream a reality by incorporating your custom artwork into the finished product. Bring us your artwork, a symbol, an emblem, a company name or logo and we can make it happen! We can even work from old photos, computer-generated images, or a picture drawn on a napkin!</p>
<p>We believe in the use of stamped and texturized impressions versus rolled impressions, as our method penetrates deep into the concrete surface to leave a lasting impression of your design. We can make your surface appear to be made of wood, marble, tile and even leather – all with the added concrete benefits of strength and durability!</p>
<p>Your finished product will stand the test of time with beauty and grace. For custom work performed by proven experts in your area, trust your concrete needs to Lowell Russell Concrete. We guarantee you will be satisfied with the results!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Lowell Russell Concrete we&#8217;re always dreaming in color, especially when it comes to decorative concrete, and we can make our dreams your reality!</p>
<p>No longer does concrete need to be displayed in drab and humdrum variations of gray, light gray and dark gray. With 24 primary colors to choose from, and countless color combinations of each, Lowell Russell Concrete can bring vibrant colors and beauty into your home through custom stained concrete. Stains can also be applied to resemble other surfaces and materials, such as natural stone, tile, marble, wood, or even leather.</p>
<p>Close your eyes&#8230;visualize the concrete around your pool as festive mosaic tiles, your fireplace mantle as stunning polished marble, your floors a richly textured hardwood, or your countertops to look like solid gleaming granite. We can quickly and easily help you achieve these appearances both inside your home and surrounding property.</p>
<p>You may ask, why imitate a substance when you could simply use actual tile, marble or wood? The answer is quite simple; concrete lasts longer while achieving the same effect. And, even better, if the concrete is already in place, you don’t have to go to the trouble and expense to rip it out and replace it with a different material.</p>
<p>How does staining work? Lowell and Russell Concrete uses a process called “Chemstaining,&#8221; which is an acidic stain that chemically reacts with cured concrete. This process can be applied to newly poured or existing concrete, and through this method, permanent, variegated or translucent effects can be fashioned into your interior and exterior concrete structures.</p>
<p>How long does the color last? Unlike a painted surface, stained concrete will hold the color as long as the concrete itself lasts, won’t fade as quickly when exposed to sunlight, or require constant maintenance and repainting as the years go by.</p>
<p>Give you home a facelift! If you want to refresh the look of your home today without completely remodeling your surfaces, give us a call.
