										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Lowell Russell Concrete, our passion lies in designing timeless custom interior and exterior concrete structures for our customers. We are a family-owned business based in Minnesota and have over 35 years of experience in the concrete industry.</p>
<p>We have been continually recognized by the Better Business Bureau and Angie’s List for our excellence in customer service, and we intend to continue that tradition in the years to come.</p>
<p>We have designed numerous interior and exterior structures for our community and neighbors that range from the unique to the extraordinary, and we use only the highest quality materials and latest proven technology in our concrete mix, stains, impressions, custom art reproduction and stenciling.</p>
<p>We offer an extensive variety of concrete products, ranging from exterior surfaces such as driveways, walkways, patios and pools, to interior surfaces such as countertops, floors, and, yes, even furniture!</p>
<p>With 24 primary color stains or any combination of each, you can choose from a full color palate to obtain the exact color(s) you wish to achieve. Our Chemstaining process ensures that the color will last as long as your concrete, and will not fade or discolor with time or exposure to the elements.</p>
<p>Our design department can make your dream a reality by incorporating your custom artwork into the finished product. Bring us your artwork, a symbol, an emblem, a company name or logo and we can make it happen! We can even work from old photos, computer-generated images, or a picture drawn on a napkin!</p>
<p>We believe in the use of stamped and texturized impressions versus rolled impressions, as our method penetrates deep into the concrete surface to leave a lasting impression of your design. We can make your surface appear to be made of wood, marble, tile and even leather – all with the added concrete benefits of strength and durability!</p>
<p>Your finished product will stand the test of time with beauty and grace. For custom work performed by proven experts in your area, trust your concrete needs to Lowell Russell Concrete. We guarantee you will be satisfied with the results!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are three main ingredients to a successful backyard BBQ – friends, food and ambiance. We can’t help you with the friends or the food (although we would certainly appreciate an invitation!), but we can help you with the ambiance. In fact, even if you have just a few friends over or the hot dogs get a bit burned, you can still leave your guests with a favorable impression that will keep them talking for weeks to come.</p>
<p>It all comes down to the beautiful presentation that can be created in your outdoor environment by using decorative concrete. Think walkways and patios; one attractively leads the way to your event and the other brilliantly showcases it.</p>
<p>Walkways</p>
<p>Pave your path to success. One of the first things your guests will see is the walkway leading to your party. Make it memorable! By using textured or imprinted concrete you can create the illusion of stone, while adding edging along the sides can give it a distinctive look. Design the walkway to  wind and meander through your gardens to highlight your flowing garden blooms from the best angles, and as the walkway nears your patio consider adding color to make it &#8220;pop&#8221; to set the stage for your main event.</p>
<p>Patios</p>
<p>Create a focal point for your party by designing an open, airy space to welcome and comfort friends and family. A conversation pit or a fireplace will draw your guests to the center to socialize. A graduated-level patio invites folks to stroll about and provides them with various viewpoints of the yard. If space allows, combine of all three!</p>
<p>Using textured or imprinted concrete on your patio will further add to the feeling you would like to achieve; a rustic feel through a wooden texture, a modern look with smooth geometrical shapes, a poolside ambience with mosaic tile, or a personalized flair with a custom pattern.</p>
<p>Between creating the guest list and planning the menu, you’re going to be busy, and probably a little stressed. Lowell Russell Concrete is here to give you one less thing to worry about by designing and constructing the outdoor environment you dream of!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Does the words “creative” and “concrete” seem counter-intuitive and paradoxical when used in the same sentence? If they do, please read on!</p>
<p>First, make a list of all of the ways concrete can be used. Did you come up with highways, driveways, sidewalks and stairs? In other words, did you come up with surfaces you can drive or walk on? These are all common uses of concrete, the importance of which should not be underestimated. After all, who wants to walk on a muddy pathway or drive across a rickety bridge made out of planks?</p>
<p>Now, think of concrete surfaces that you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cannot</span> drive or walk on. Can’t think of anything? Okay, how about surfaces you can place things on, like countertops, tables and shelves. These didn&#8217;t come to mind either? They should, because there are so many more uses for concrete than what many people ever thought possible!</p>
<p>Envision a kitchen countertop crafted out of concrete that looks like granite or tile, but doesn’t chip or crack. Imagine your next board meeting held around a concrete conference table that appears to be crafted of beautifully polished wood. The perfect match of durability and elegance that is naturally impervious to the stains, blemishes and discoloration that would ruin a wood table! Think of a marble fireplace mantel, leather-topped end tables or solid oak decorative shelving &#8211; all made out of concrete!</p>
<p>The uses of concrete are infinite, and Lowell Russell Concrete strives to create the most functional designs and creations imaginable. Factor in color, custom design, texturing and imprinting and you have a lasting and personalized piece of artwork.</p>
<p>Lowell Russell Concrete can create a unique piece or interior theme for you through our innovative and scientific use of concrete staining, personalized imprinting, decorative framing and edgework. We can design and create an application specifically to fit your needs, or take your design and craft the item or construct the space you desire.</p>
<p>When you think “concrete,” think outside of the box..think Lowell Russell Concrete!</p>
