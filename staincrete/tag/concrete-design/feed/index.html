										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is continuity when it comes to design? Continuity is an essential element which encompasses all the aspects of design and function including working from the same color palette throughout a home or place of business. Why is it important? It creates a sense of flow that gives you, your family members and guests a sense of ease and comfort. At Lowell Russell Concrete, our design capabilities and craftsmanship are ideally suited to creating a visual and functional sense of continuity at an affordable and highly competitive price.</p>
<p>Imagine using stained concrete for your driveway and/or walkway and then using the same color of concrete for your countertop. You might want to utilize stamped concrete for your outdoor projects while using smooth concrete for the countertops.  Or, if you’ve always wanted a tiled countertop, concrete can be textured and colored do that too!</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve always wanted an outdoor kitchen, pool or gathering space. Create it with concrete! It’s another opportunity to tie design themes together inside and outside of your home. Create a dramatic color contrast between your indoor and outdoor living areas or design the passages between the indoor and outdoor spaces with subtle color changes to produce distinctive environments.</p>
<p>For your place of business, a recreation of your company logo stamped into concrete at the building entrance or on the floor or the counter of the receptionist’s desk is one great way to use continuity of style. It doesn’t matter what your design preference is, the great thing about concrete is how versatile it is. From a modern or industrial look to classic elegance to nature-inspired design, concrete can do it all.</p>
<p>For all you want created with concrete, contact <a title="Lowell Russell Concrete in Minnesota" href="https://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a>. We offer a variety of concrete services, including interior and exterior applications, staining, stenciling and imprinting of concrete.</p>
