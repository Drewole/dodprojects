										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today&#8217;s world it often seems that what we thought was a rock solid choice for a long-term home or business improvement turns out to be something far less in quality and value. Whether it was the result of substandard materials or the wrong solution for a specific application, nothing is more frustrating than to see your desired improvement go from good to bad as fast as the weather can change here in Minnesota.</p>
<p>With that said, there is a product that is highly durable, well suited for our tough Minnesota weather, and rarely disappoints &#8211; concrete! Concrete is extremely hard-wearing and made to last. At Lowell Russell Concrete we work diligently to assist you in designing and creating a finished product that don’t sacrifice attributes such as color, texture and appearance. So forget about all of those preconceived notions you may have about concrete looking sterile, boring, gray all day and &#8220;cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new age of decorative concrete is definitely here, so it’s time to consider the “warmth” and functional exquisiteness that can be produced with concrete! Whether you are considering a countertop for your indoor kitchen or outdoor barbeque, walkways or driveways, foyers or patios, or even outdoor furniture, there is nothing like the durability of concrete. If you like to spend your time outdoors, perhaps you want to consider transforming your current bare-bones patio space into an “outside family room.” Just think of the possibilities for a tranquil outdoor alcove or a fabulous entertainment environment &#8211; a wonderfully crafted fireplace in the corner, a patio surface stained and etched to your artistic desires, and your patio tables and chairs for just a few or a few dozen that are virtually indestructible. With a minimum amount of care and maintenance, these innovative items will remain for generations to enjoy!</p>
<p>If your curiosity is stirred, take a look at some of the pictures in our furniture gallery: <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshogallery/Furniture__4_303.php">http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshogallery/Furniture__4_303.php</a>. You’ll discover some interesting &#8220;concrete&#8221; examples of how exquisite concrete furniture can be! If planning a change to your indoor or outdoor space, consider concrete as a rock solid choice!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is continuity when it comes to design? Continuity is an essential element which encompasses all the aspects of design and function including working from the same color palette throughout a home or place of business. Why is it important? It creates a sense of flow that gives you, your family members and guests a sense of ease and comfort. At Lowell Russell Concrete, our design capabilities and craftsmanship are ideally suited to creating a visual and functional sense of continuity at an affordable and highly competitive price.</p>
<p>Imagine using stained concrete for your driveway and/or walkway and then using the same color of concrete for your countertop. You might want to utilize stamped concrete for your outdoor projects while using smooth concrete for the countertops.  Or, if you’ve always wanted a tiled countertop, concrete can be textured and colored do that too!</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve always wanted an outdoor kitchen, pool or gathering space. Create it with concrete! It’s another opportunity to tie design themes together inside and outside of your home. Create a dramatic color contrast between your indoor and outdoor living areas or design the passages between the indoor and outdoor spaces with subtle color changes to produce distinctive environments.</p>
<p>For your place of business, a recreation of your company logo stamped into concrete at the building entrance or on the floor or the counter of the receptionist’s desk is one great way to use continuity of style. It doesn’t matter what your design preference is, the great thing about concrete is how versatile it is. From a modern or industrial look to classic elegance to nature-inspired design, concrete can do it all.</p>
<p>For all you want created with concrete, contact <a title="Lowell Russell Concrete in Minnesota" href="https://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a>. We offer a variety of concrete services, including interior and exterior applications, staining, stenciling and imprinting of concrete.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[So, go ahead and build your castle. Lowell Russell Concrete will make it stands the test of time and be there for the generations to come!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that the dome of the Roman Pantheon was built with the use of concrete in 126 AD and, despite other concrete structures new and old, holds the world record for the largest unreinforced concrete dome? If you’ve had the fortune of traveling to Italy you may have noticed how well it has held up for almost 2,000 years. Not too shabby!</p>
<p>Concrete is durable. Durability refers to the ability to last a long time without significant wear and tear. Not only does this mean that the structure itself will hold up longer, but in the long run conserves on the natural resources required every time a new structure is built. It also reduces waste that accompanies the destruction of existing structures.</p>
<p>In fact, concrete often exceeds its own building design life expectancy. Most concrete structures are destroyed not because they are falling apart, but because they are no longer needed or a totally new structure is desired. More often than not, a concrete structure can be &#8220;recycled&#8221; with interior changes or by altering the face of the building.</p>
<p>What makes concrete so durable?</p>
<p>1.     Composition: Concrete is a composite material, meaning that it is made from at least two discrete substances. Concrete is primarily composed of aggregate (coarse gravel or crushed rocks), cement and water.  As with any composite material, durability is dependent upon the proper mixture of these materials.<br />
2.    Fire resistant: Quite simply, concrete does not burn.<br />
3.    Wind resistant: Concrete has minimal horizontal movement and provides greater protection during high winds, tornadoes and hurricanes.<br />
4.    Ultraviolet resistant: Concrete is not harmed by ultraviolet rays from the sun, nor do pigments in concrete fade as quickly as paint.<br />
5.    Vermin-proof: Concrete is inedible, even for those with not so discriminating taste.  Therefore, it is not subject to vermin and insects as many other building materials are, such as wood and plaster.</p>
<p>So, go ahead and build your castle. <a title="Lowell Russell Concrete in Minnesota" href="https://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete </a>will make it stands the test of time and be there for the generations to come!</p>
