										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Lowell Russell Concrete, our passion lies in designing timeless custom interior and exterior concrete structures for our customers. We are a family-owned business based in Minnesota and have over 35 years of experience in the concrete industry.</p>
<p>We have been continually recognized by the Better Business Bureau and Angie’s List for our excellence in customer service, and we intend to continue that tradition in the years to come.</p>
<p>We have designed numerous interior and exterior structures for our community and neighbors that range from the unique to the extraordinary, and we use only the highest quality materials and latest proven technology in our concrete mix, stains, impressions, custom art reproduction and stenciling.</p>
<p>We offer an extensive variety of concrete products, ranging from exterior surfaces such as driveways, walkways, patios and pools, to interior surfaces such as countertops, floors, and, yes, even furniture!</p>
<p>With 24 primary color stains or any combination of each, you can choose from a full color palate to obtain the exact color(s) you wish to achieve. Our Chemstaining process ensures that the color will last as long as your concrete, and will not fade or discolor with time or exposure to the elements.</p>
<p>Our design department can make your dream a reality by incorporating your custom artwork into the finished product. Bring us your artwork, a symbol, an emblem, a company name or logo and we can make it happen! We can even work from old photos, computer-generated images, or a picture drawn on a napkin!</p>
<p>We believe in the use of stamped and texturized impressions versus rolled impressions, as our method penetrates deep into the concrete surface to leave a lasting impression of your design. We can make your surface appear to be made of wood, marble, tile and even leather – all with the added concrete benefits of strength and durability!</p>
<p>Your finished product will stand the test of time with beauty and grace. For custom work performed by proven experts in your area, trust your concrete needs to Lowell Russell Concrete. We guarantee you will be satisfied with the results!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post is for those who wish to make an impression upon others!</p>
<p>Imprinted concrete, also referred to as stamped, textured or patterned concrete, gives the ability to personalize and enhance your interior and exterior concrete surfaces. You can choose from hundreds of existing patterns or create your own unique design!</p>
<p>Do you have a favorite symbol or emblem, such as Fleur-de-Lis, a trinity knot, or a lotus flower? Or perhaps you wish to create an environment that imitates a specific type of material such as marble, granite, wood or tile? At Russell Lowell Concrete, we can incorporate your preferences into your interior or exterior structural designs.</p>
<p>Here are some general ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mix it up. Choose from several complementary patterns and strategically place them in a repeating or random design on your floors or patio for visual interest.</li>
<li>Give yourself an edge. Decorative patterned edging around walkways and patios can distinguish the common surface areas from your garden and provide a finished look to your exterior structures.</li>
<li>Texturize your surface. Give your floors the appearance of hardwood, your pool the look of a Romanesque pool, your countertops the sophistication of granite, or your fireplace mantel the elegance of marble.</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are few more specific ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a family crest, proudly display it on your front door step.</li>
<li>Take pride in your profession. If you are in the medical profession, incorporate a Caduceus into your design. If you are a mathematician or physicist, perhaps the Infinity symbol appeals to you.</li>
<li>Honor your faith. Integrate an Ichthys, a Celtic Cross or the Star of David into your home structures.</li>
<li>Highlight your hobby. Are you an avid gardener, a sports enthusiast, or lobbyist?  Incorporate your favorite flower, sport or political affiliation into your design.</li>
</ul>
<p>So go on, define your style, and let Lowell Russell Concrete make a lasting impression!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Attain a sense of elegance for your home without compromising on your consumer savvy.  Stained concrete paves the way to unexpected and affordable style.  With stained concrete you can enjoy the beauty of natural stone without paying the price.</p>
<p>If you are remodeling an existing home, in any outdoor or indoor living space, give stained concrete a try.  It can be difficult to find just the right natural stone, ceramic or laminate tile, countertop or table to go with the other design elements in a home when remodeling.  Hours can be spent looking and searching for just the right one and sometimes, just the right tile, countertop or table can’t be found; or, if it can be found, the price makes it more of a sacrifice than it should be.  In design conundrums like these, stained concrete saves the day.</p>
<p>Concrete can mold itself to any shape.  Stained concrete is available in an array of colors and shades.  Concrete can be stenciled, stamped, stained, etched and more.  There is an unlimited amount of ways concrete can be designed and utilized.  From where your welcome mat lies outside your door to your kitchen counter, from your bedroom night stand to your outdoor entertainment space, concrete paves the way for today’s stylish consumers.  No other material is as flexible in style, form or function.</p>
<p>Before looking at other options, sifting through catalogs to fine just the right thing only to find out that it is price exclusive, start your search with stained concrete.  Since you can create whatever look you want with it, you’ll avoid the hassle of running from store to store and searching stacks of magazines for the idea you have, that you know would be just right, if only somebody made it.</p>
<p>Your concrete design expert can create whatever design you can imagine.  If you need to see some options to get you started, your concrete design expert can offer that as well. For service that meets your needs, wherever you are at in your remodeling process and material that is able to do the same, <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshorequest-a-quote.php">contact us for a free quote</a>. We offer a variety of concrete services, including interior and exterior applications, staining, stenciling and imprinting of concrete.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is continuity when it comes to design? Continuity is an essential element which encompasses all the aspects of design and function including working from the same color palette throughout a home or place of business. Why is it important? It creates a sense of flow that gives you, your family members and guests a sense of ease and comfort. At Lowell Russell Concrete, our design capabilities and craftsmanship are ideally suited to creating a visual and functional sense of continuity at an affordable and highly competitive price.</p>
<p>Imagine using stained concrete for your driveway and/or walkway and then using the same color of concrete for your countertop. You might want to utilize stamped concrete for your outdoor projects while using smooth concrete for the countertops.  Or, if you’ve always wanted a tiled countertop, concrete can be textured and colored do that too!</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve always wanted an outdoor kitchen, pool or gathering space. Create it with concrete! It’s another opportunity to tie design themes together inside and outside of your home. Create a dramatic color contrast between your indoor and outdoor living areas or design the passages between the indoor and outdoor spaces with subtle color changes to produce distinctive environments.</p>
<p>For your place of business, a recreation of your company logo stamped into concrete at the building entrance or on the floor or the counter of the receptionist’s desk is one great way to use continuity of style. It doesn’t matter what your design preference is, the great thing about concrete is how versatile it is. From a modern or industrial look to classic elegance to nature-inspired design, concrete can do it all.</p>
<p>For all you want created with concrete, contact <a title="Lowell Russell Concrete in Minnesota" href="https://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a>. We offer a variety of concrete services, including interior and exterior applications, staining, stenciling and imprinting of concrete.</p>
