<p>Many people enjoy the designs that can be made with bricks and traditional concrete in driveways, patios, and walkways. Unfortunately, these traditional options can leave room for weeds to pop up and spread, ruining designs like an unsightly blemish on your face. Before you accept that there’s no other option, consider a <a title="Minnesota Stamped Concrete Driveways" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoour-services.php">stamped concrete driveway or patio</a> in Lakeville, MN from <a title="Home Page" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete.</a></p>
<p>With <strong>stamped concrete</strong>, you have many different options. From the design of the main layout, to choosing the border, to picking the perfect color combinations, the personalization options are endless. <strong>Stamped concrete</strong> offers a more defined pattern that sits deeper.</p>
<p>You might be thinking that a paved driveway or patio is a simpler solution for your needs, but you may be forgetting one key factor: frost. For a naturally flat surface, <strong>stamped concrete</strong> will move more smoothly with the frost and thaw cycle our area experiences each winter and spring.</p>
<p>Less invasion from weeds, high, personalized aesthetics, and freedom of movement are just a few of the major <strong>benefits of stamped concrete.</strong> You can discover more by <a title="Contact Us" href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoexterior-concrete.php">contacting Lowell Russell Concrete</a> to discuss your <strong>stamped concrete</strong> options in Lakeville, MN.</p>

<p>As spring-like weather finally begins to show its face in Southeastern Minnesota, it is time to get rid of the winter doldrums and spend time outside. One of the most gratifying ways to do this is to spend time relaxing on the patio. If grilling, entertaining, and spending time with family and friends is something you do best, a patio is the perfect choice to get the job done. Contact <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho"><strong>Lowell Russell Concrete</strong> </a>to get the long overdue project of a Lakeville, MN <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopatios.php"><strong>concrete patio</strong></a> started today.</p>
<p>Relaxation is something most of us need more of. Because of hectic schedules, family obligations, and work, relaxation often times takes the back seat. This eventually makes us tense, stressed, and unhealthy. Having a <strong>concrete patio</strong> with some comfortable chairs, a table, and other amenities provides plentiful amounts of enjoyment and delight. A time to relax, take in the sun and Mother Nature’s gifts, visit with family and friends, or read a good book—all of which decrease our stress level and make us happier and healthier.</p>
<p>Whether you choose a concrete slab, pavers, or some other design and style, a patio is sure to provide years of enjoyment, delight, and pleasure. At the end of the day, when you want a retreat from the busy-ness around you, your patio can become your sanctuary. Perhaps flower gardens or rock gardens along with a fountain mixed-in next to or within your patio can provide hours of relaxation. Stoke up a fire, start the grill, get some comfortable furniture, and invite friends or family to enjoy a festive barbeque. On a calm summers eve take in the fragrances of fresh blossoms in your beautiful, serene yard. Or simply enjoy the atmosphere with a good book and quiet time to appreciate the sounds and scents of nature around you.</p>
<p><a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopatios.php">Contact the professionals at Lowell Russell Concrete today</a> for inspiring ideas, designs, and styles for your <strong>concrete patio</strong>. Our trained and experienced staffs offer the highest quality <strong>exterior concrete services</strong>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Lowell Russell Concrete | Providing concrete pools in Lakeville, MN and surrounding communities</h2>
<p>With nicer weather upon us and the itch to be outside after the long, harsh winter, let your mind wander to the lazy days of summer! Think scorching hot rays of the sun, an even tan, and cooling off in the swimming pool. Sounds awesome, uplifting and a real treat, right? Have you thought about installing your own pool, or do you currently have a pool that is beginning to look a little weathered and needs some attention? Now is the time to think this project through, whether you need repairs or wish to begin the planning process to build your own pool. Contact the professionals at <strong>Lowell Russell Concrete</strong> for inspiring ideas, designs, and shapes for your <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopools.php"><strong>concrete pool</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Concrete swimming pools</strong> have a great advantage when compared to other types of pools such as fiberglass or vinyl lined pools. Vinyl lined pools have been shown to be less durable, and the risk of tears, stains, and leaks is much higher when compared to concrete. <strong>Concrete pools</strong> can be customized and feature additional amenities such as waterfalls if desired. The shapes and designs are endless, depending on your wants, needs, and desires. Another enhancement for added attraction is to line the pool with tiles, thus adding a unique, eye-catching look.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you already have a pool or are thinking of installing one, proper upkeep and repair is a necessity. A pool that is properly winterized can be readied for the summer months relatively easily and will last for many, many years.</p>
<p>A backyard oasis can be yours by installing not only a pool, but a patio and serene surroundings as well. Maybe you’ve always dreamed of a spa or a pool and pool house to entertain your guests. Perhaps a grotto, a fire pit, or an outdoor kitchen is on your bucket list. All of this can be accomplished with a little creative planning!</p>
<p><a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoexterior-concrete.php">Contact the professional team at Lowell Russell Concrete today</a> to discuss and plan your <strong>concrete pool</strong>, patio, and other items to create your own backyard oasis. Like the saying says, “Relax and take in the abundance of life.” &#8211; Author Unknown.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Lowell Russell Concrete | Lakeville, MN Concrete Driveways, Concrete Countertops, and More!</h2>
<p>Ground frost, inclement weather, and wear and tear can take its toll on concrete causing sinking, cracking, unevenness and other <strong>concrete problems</strong>. If you are experiencing any of these problems with your driveway, sidewalk, patio, or pool area, it may be time to contact the team at <strong>Lowell Russell Concrete </strong>for concrete solutions including <strong>concrete countertops</strong> and <strong>concrete driveways</strong> in Lakeville, MN.</p>
<p>The ground frost this past winter went exceptionally deep. Coupled with wear and tear, ground frost can wreak havoc on concrete streets as well as in and around our homes. It is typically best to repair cracks, sinking, and the effects of wear and tear sooner rather than later, as it may become quite expensive if repairs are not completed in a timely manner. The tough winter and spring seasons can play a huge role in concrete problems as well as your budget. High traffic concrete typically takes a lot of punishment. Proper repairs can save you from future damage as well as ensure the safety of those walking on patios and sidewalks. If you notice that cracking is a recurring problem, it may be best to call in the professionals to find the contributing factors instead of doing just cosmetic repair.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to repair interior or<strong> exterior concrete</strong>. Determining the appropriate types of materials to make proper repairs is crucial to ensure future durability. When you have a strong and well repaired floor, driveway, or sidewalk, it increases the value of your property, and ensures the safety of your family, friends, workers, or all who may enter.</p>
<p>If you have interior or <strong>exterior concrete</strong> that is cracking or sinking, breakage, potholes, or other concrete problems or worries, please give us a call. Our professional staff can address your concerns and provide the expert workmanship and quality products to correct problems or completely replace failing concrete. We’ve all been waiting for spring, and now that it is here and Mother Nature’s winter has taken its toll, get your <strong>concrete repaired</strong> for safety and increase the value of your home today. Then you can enjoy the lazy days of summer by the pool area with friends and family. Now that’s living! <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshopatios.php">Contact Lowell Russell Concrete today</a>!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Lowell Russell Concrete | Lakeville, MN Concrete Installation and Preservation</h2>
<p>If you look around your home, you will see that you probably have quite a bit of <strong>concrete</strong> – from sidewalks to patios to driveways. With the harsh winters in the Midwest, the ground frost has a depth of several feet, particularly this year with the sub-zero temperatures hitting us for many consecutive days. Because of this, ice can form below concrete surfaces and cause it to heave or crack. Many experts say that the bigger the crack, the bigger the problem. Frost heaving of concrete is the result of pressure created from a combination of freezing temperatures and soil defrosting and is one of the main reasons for damage to patios, sidewalks, driveways, and even streets or highways. If concrete is installed and poured properly, heaving can be avoided and your patio or sidewalk will look as perfect when spring rolls around as it did last summer before the cold and freezing temperatures were upon us. The professionals at<strong> Lowell Russell Concrete</strong> take pride in their work and will make every effort to get and keep your Lakeville, MN <strong>concrete project</strong> just the way you dreamed it would be—free of heaving or cracking and beautiful to show off to guests.</p>
<p><strong>Curing of concrete</strong> is an important aspect of keeping your <strong>concrete patio</strong> or area looking great and holding up during the harsh winters and thawing springs in the Midwest. With proper curing and hydration, the strength, durability, and look of the concrete are increased greatly. Proper and complete curing generally requires a period of 7-10 days after pouring of the concrete. Warmer weather and hydration are typically needed for concrete to cure properly and allow for a durable surface. If you have no other option than to pour concrete during a colder time of the year, frost blankets should be used to ensure proper curing.</p>
<p>There are several different types of cracks and heaving that you need to look for in keeping your concreting in top-notch condition:<br />
• Hairline cracks are quite small and typically do not threaten the structure of your <strong>concrete</strong>, but they can become a point for ground water to enter, thus making the problem worse with time.<br />
• Spalling is flaking, peeling, and erosion of the top layer of concrete and is typically caused by expansion and contraction of moisture during the freeze and thaw cycles.<br />
• Settling is a sagging or caving of the concrete. This often times results from poorly drained or poorly compacted soil, causing the ground underneath to be unstable.<br />
• Heaving as noted above is caused from the freeze and thaw cycles.</p>
<p>Because the changing weather is constantly attacking homeowners, <strong>concrete sealing</strong> plays an important role along with proper installation, upkeep and maintenance. <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Contact the trained professionals at <strong>Lowell Russell Concrete</strong></a> to help with proper installation of your <strong>concrete project</strong> to make your dreams come true. Keep this quote in mind, “Your dreams are like the cement. If you water it with actions, it becomes a hard concrete mass. But if you leave it exposed and unwatered, the air will easily blow it away!” ― Israelmore Avivor</p>

<p>Spring is just a few days away, or so the calendar states. Many are beginning to get Spring Fever and hoping to get outside, roll up their sleeves, and start cleaning up after our harsh Midwest winter. With spring in the air, the construction business will begin to ramp up as well. The visualization of planting some flowers and a garden, cleaning up the yard, and walking with our galoshes to make splashes and sloshes sounds quite appealing. With spring thinking, perhaps a new or updated patio is also on your list of jobs to be done. <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpsho">Lowell Russell Concrete</a> can help you fulfill your dream of getting into the “spring” of things with <strong>stamped concrete patios</strong> in Lakeville, MN.</p>
<p><strong>Stamped concrete</strong> is becoming more and more popular in today’s market. A<strong> stamped concrete patio</strong> gives you the look of a stone patio for a lot less than pavers or other options. Pavers can be much more labor intense and time consuming, whereas stamped concrete requires less maintenance with a simple coat of clear sealer every few years. The biggest advantage of <strong>stamped concrete</strong> is its versatility, plus there&#8217;s no worry about tripping hazards as it is one continuous slab of concrete. Because the pattern is stamped into the concrete the “stones” won’t settle over time or create uneven surfaces. Grass and weeds will not sprout between the stones as there is no grout, joints, or filler for the weeds to sneak through.</p>
<p>With the look to mimic brick, cobblestones, or cracked earth, <strong>stamped concrete</strong> is sure to fit in with your entertaining décor. Different patterns, shapes, and textures are readily available in many different colors to give your patio the look you desire and become the inviting retreat for yourself and your guests.<br />
If you already have a concrete patio that is in good shape, you can add a stamped finish to achieve the look you desire. Remember, though, that you will be raising the height of the old slab, so you will want to be certain the new surface doesn&#8217;t interfere with things like existing steps and foundation walls.</p>
