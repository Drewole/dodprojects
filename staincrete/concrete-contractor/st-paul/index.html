<h2>Exterior Concrete St Paul</h2>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2017/10/exterior-concrete.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-597 size-full" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2017/10/exterior-concrete.jpg" alt="Exterior Concrete St Paul, Minnesota by Lowell Russell Concrete 55101–55175" width="400" height="325" srcset="../../wp-content/uploads/2017/10/exterior-concrete.jpg 400w,../../wp-content/uploads/2017/10/exterior-concrete-300x244.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></a>For years, concrete has earned a reputation as a strong and durable material for everything from patios to driveways and sidewalks. Rightfully so. A well-formulated and properly placed concrete patio can last for many years and look nearly identical to when it was poured. Unfortunately, in the past, when people hear “Concrete” they conjure images of your typical gray slab. And although sometimes that’s exactly what you want, it can be so much more. Concrete can be more than durable. Concrete can be beautiful. It can be a statement.</p>
<p>In the past, people were forced to use expensive natural stone as there was no other alternative that can match the required strength and aesthetic look they needed for their home. Today, concrete frees homeowners from having to use high end materials alone. Concrete offers a low-cost alternative that is perfect for large areas such as patios, driveways, steps, walkways and pools. Not only does concrete offer thousands of dollars in savings but it can also create a more beautiful product, one that is completely customizable in order to complement the existing aesthetic of the home. The durability of concrete makes it the perfect option for homeowners in the long term. It requires little maintenance and upkeep and lasts for decades if cared for correctly. Concrete offers decorative designs, borders and colors that seemingly were reserved only for natural stone or brick but is now readily available at a fraction of the cost. With concrete you will be able to create the perfect curb appeal you’ve always wanted while also adding tremendous value to your property.</p>
<p>Why is concrete so versatile? Concrete can be shaped into any form whatsoever. It can be colored to look antiquated in order to produce an “aged” look or mimic any natural material available like marble, brick or granite. There is almost no limit to what concrete is capable of.  If correctly prepared and finished using industry accepted methods, your concrete can last you decades and can possibly last longer and look better longer than any natural material.  Due to this intrinsic characteristic, concrete can be used in virtually any home project your heart desires. Its natural strength complemented with its beauty makes it the premiere construction material today.<br><a class="grey-btn" href="/contact/free-estimate/">Get a Free Estimate ></a></p>

<h2>Concrete Floor St Paul</h2>
<p>Concrete is the new building material of choice for home designers and owners throughout the world. Because <a href="../../services/interior-concrete/floors/index.html">concrete floors</a> can be stained, colored, painted, and personalized, they are universally popping up in business and home décor. Nearly limitless in design, color and texture, a concrete floor in St Paul offers numerous options for exterior and interior areas.</p>
<p>Currently, the most common place you’ll find decorative concrete is under your feet. Whether it’s acid-stained, painted, created with overlays, stencils, radiant floors, you’re your unique personal floor, concrete floors offer design and functionality unlike any other material. <strong>Concrete flooring</strong>, often referred to as cement flooring, does not need to be boring and gray. Modern techniques can bring new life to this traditional substrate.</p>
<p>There is already a lot of good stuff that has been said about concrete and for good reason too. Concrete in itself is equal parts sturdy and sleek, not to mention quite easy to maintain.  It is therefore the best choice of material to use on your floors. Here are some of the great benefits to concrete floors.</p>
<h2>Concrete Staining St Paul</h2>
<p>Concrete is a blank canvas and the stain is the hue that can transform it from a simple gray color to stunning shades that can make your home truly beautiful and inviting. <a href="../../services/interior-concrete/concrete-staining/index.html">Concrete staining</a> is the perfect means to impart an opulent richness that is not achievable from any other method.  As opposed to producing a single opaque effect like what you would normally see in paint, staining the concrete allows it to infuse deep into the mix so as to create vibrant translucent colors that vary depending on the surface they are applied to as well as the method used. What you get is a concrete wall, floor or slab that can look like anything from natural stone, brick and even wood if you want it to be.</p>
<p>Chemstaining is a ready to use, penetrating acidic stain that chemically reacts with cured concrete to produce permanent, variegated or translucent effects. Chemical Staining allows for more creative and artistic designs to be possible. They can be used to simulate other products; such as tile, wood, and stone; and create original designs never before imagined with concrete. It brings the durability and strength of concrete to table, countertops, entryways, and decks which concrete would usually not be a consideration. The flexibility to give a new look to old concrete without the major undertaking of the tear out.</p>
<h2>Concrete Countertops St Paul</h2>
<p>There is no better material out there today that features unparalleled durability, adaptability and overall cost-effectiveness than concrete. This is the reason why <a href="../../services/interior-concrete/concrete-countertops/index.html">concrete countertops</a> are making waves in just about anything related to interior design. Concrete countertops can transform your kitchen from drab to fab through the application of coloring and staining methods. It is a sure fire way to infuse your home with a rustic but modern look that is not only trendy but clean at the same time.</p>
<p>Concrete countertops can be customized into any shape in order to fit any kitchen configuration. No matter how big or small your space is, we can create a countertop perfect for you. Concrete is also very resistant to scratching and is not affected by heat. It is easy to clean and maintain. All you need to do is ensure that regular sealing is done.</p>
<p>Since most concrete countertops are made from scratch, there are a variety of options for you to choose from when it comes to the finish. You can get mirror-smooth or stone-like textures depending on your preference. In some instances, the surface of the form itself becomes the finish, as the texture is replicated in the concrete itself.  Troweling the concrete surface can create original hand-made textural effects while polishing or sanding the concrete after it has been cast can result in an ultra-smooth and perfect surface. Polishing methods may also be done in order to expose the aggregate, stone or glass within in order to establish the terrazzo look.<br><a class="grey-btn" href="/contact/free-estimate/">Get a Free Estimate ></a></p>
<h2>Concrete Stencils St Paul</h2>
<p>Since their introduction in the 1980s, <a href="../../services/interior-concrete/concrete-stencils/index.html">concrete stencils</a> became all the rage as they quickly and efficiently replicated the look of hand-laid brick over a newly poured concrete surface. In those days only one stencil pattern was available but today there is an endless array of patterns for you to choose from ranging from brick, tile, cobblestone, slate and flagstone to customized concrete stencils that create the look of lush looking carpets for your floors.</p>
<h3>Concrete  Stencils Are Excellent Alternative to Stamping</h3>
<p>Concrete stencils offer an excellent alternative to concrete stamping as stenciling is quicker to do and can be done using long-handed tools. The pattern comes courtesy of the stencils and the texturing is achieved using lightweight textured rollers. Unlike stamping, that requires you to go on the slab, check to see if it can bear your weight and then apply the stamp by hand, with stenciling there is no need for all of that. Depending on the weather, concrete may set in fairly quickly and there is a limited window for it to be textured adequately, concrete stencils solves that problem because the process can start as soon as the concrete is installed and may even be don before the concrete is good enough for the stamping process to start.</p>

						<ul class="royalSlider rsDefault cf"><li><p>I just want to take a moment of your time to compliment you, Lee and the rest of your company on the outstanding floor you installed at the old South St. Paul Exchange Building. My wife and I went to Trivina's for dinner last week and were very impressed with the floor and the bar tops that were installed. We really enjoyed our meal and the ambiance there, but the floor is what really caught my eye. The workmanship and detail was very exact and done to perfection.  It is something you should be very proud of! Hopefully the project will be maintained and taken care of. It sure is a show piece and is good not only for your company but the whole architectural concrete industry!</p>

							<li><p>Lowell, I wanted to write and tell you how happy we are with the end result on our two patios. I know our job was a tough one to begin with, and needless to say it didn't always go according to plan. However, through your efforts and expertise the patio's look fabulous and go great with the stone on the house. It has been a healthy exercise for me to be a landscape customer and to experience what happens from the customer's point of view. I now know why Daryl thinks so highly of you. Bachman's really makes an effort to use the best sub contractors, and you certainly belong high up on that list. Thanks again for a job well done.</p>

							<li><p>We are delighted with the patio - it looks terrific. We are looking forward to enjoying out new patio in Spring. We enjoyed watching the process of this being completed, and were very impressed with you and your assistants and how well everything was kept cleaned and picked up. Thank you again for the great experience. We will gladly recommend you to others, and if we find ourselves with another concrete project, we will definitely be calling you again.</p>

							<li><p>Lowell, thank you and your team, we love the way out patio looks. Please feel free to use us as a reference or take pictures for your overflowing book.</p>

							<li><p>I hired Lowell Russell to pour the floors of my home with 4,000 square foot footprint, and I would hire him again. He is a master and it shows. Additionally, his prices were fair, he did what he said he would do, and kept me informed every step of the way. </p>

							<li><p>The patios are beautiful. Thanks to you and your work crews for a job well done. We appreciated the beauty of your work. We will definitely recommend your work to others.</p>
