Because of our dedication, we offer the highest quality exterior and interior concrete products and services available.</p>
<h2>Exterior Concrete Lakeville</h2>
<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2017/10/exterior-concrete.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-597 size-full" src="../wp-content/uploads/2017/10/exterior-concrete.jpg" alt="Exterior Concrete Lakeville" width="400" height="325" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2017/10/exterior-concrete.jpg 400w,../wp-content/uploads/2017/10/exterior-concrete-300x244.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></a>For years, concrete has earned a reputation as a strong and durable material for everything from patios to driveways and sidewalks. Rightfully so. A well-formulated and properly poured concrete patio can last for many years and look nearly identical to when it was poured. Unfortunately, in the past, when people hear “Concrete” they conjure images of your typical gray slab. And although sometimes that’s exactly what you want, it can be so much more. Concrete can be more than durable. Concrete can be beautiful. It can be stunning.</p>
<p>Architectural concrete, as a low-cost alternative, presents homeowners with significant savings for large areas, such as driveways and patios, as well as steps, walkways and pools. Not only is concrete less expensive, but the decorative designs, borders and colors possible with architectural concrete will enhance your home and add to its value.</p>

<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2017/10/interior-concrete.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-598 size-full" src="../wp-content/uploads/2017/10/interior-concrete.jpg" alt="Interior Concrete Lakeville" width="400" height="302" srcset="../wp-content/uploads/2017/10/interior-concrete.jpg 400w,../wp-content/uploads/2017/10/interior-concrete-300x227.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></a>Lowell Russell Concrete of Lakeville has engineered systems that allow the creation of beautiful and unique architectural concrete floors for new home construction or renovation projects.</p>
<p>No interior flooring is as flexible and durable as concrete. Concrete floors can be as cozy as carpet. They can be as classy as hardwood. And concrete will remain beautiful long after those other materials have frayed or faded. When done right, concrete is stunning and durable and easy to clean and maintain. It should be the first option when you think of interior flooring.</p>
<p>Unique, colored variegated or translucent effects are achievable with chemical staining. Complementing the most contemporary decor, individualistic theme or traditional design, Lowell Russell Concrete systems offer value with virtually limitless potential for design with remarkably diverse range of style applications. Materials such as terrazzo, slate, hardwood, or imported tile can be replicated on moderate budgets.</p>
<h3>Concrete Staining Lakeville</h3>
<p>Chemstaining is a ready to use, penetrating acidic stain that chemically reacts with cured concrete to produce permanent, variegated or translucent effects. Chemical Staining allows for more creative and artistic designs to be possible. They can be used to simulate other products; such as tile, wood, and stone; and create original designs never before imagined with concrete. It brings the durability and strength of concrete to table, countertops, entryways, and decks which concrete would usually not be a consideration. The flexibility to give a new look to old concrete without the major undertaking of the tear out.</p>
<h3>Concrete Floor Lakeville</h3>
<p>Concrete is the new building material of choice for home designers and owners throughout the country. Because <a href="../services/interior-concrete/floors/index.html">concrete floors</a> can be stained, colored, painted, and personalized, they are universally popping up in business and home décor. Nearly limitless in design, color and texture, a concrete floor in Lakeville offers numerous options for exterior and interior areas.</p>
<p>Currently, the most common place you’ll find decorative concrete is under your feet. Whether it’s acid-stained, painted, created with overlays, stencils, radiant floors, you’re your unique personal floor, concrete floors offer design and functionality unlike any other material. Concrete flooring, often referred to as cement flooring, does not need to be boring and gray. Modern techniques can bring new life to this traditional substrate.</p>

<h3>History of Lakeville</h3>

Due to the mostly rural landscape, the early settlers to the town were mostly farmers. Most were Scandinavian and another group composed of English, Scots and Irish also settled in the area. Incorporation to cityhood was achieved in 1967.</p>

						<ul class="royalSlider rsDefault cf"><li><p>I just want to take a moment of your time to compliment you, Lee and the rest of your company on the outstanding floor you installed at the old South St. Paul Exchange Building. My wife and I went to Trivina's for dinner last week and were very impressed with the floor and the bar tops that were installed. We really enjoyed our meal and the ambiance there, but the floor is what really caught my eye. The workmanship and detail was very exact and done to perfection.  It is something you should be very proud of! Hopefully the project will be maintained and taken care of. It sure is a show piece and is good not only for your company but the whole architectural concrete industry!</p>

							<li><p>Lowell, I wanted to write and tell you how happy we are with the end result on our two patios. I know our job was a tough one to begin with, and needless to say it didn't always go according to plan. However, through your efforts and expertise the patio's look fabulous and go great with the stone on the house. It has been a healthy exercise for me to be a landscape customer and to experience what happens from the customer's point of view. I now know why Daryl thinks so highly of you. Bachman's really makes an effort to use the best sub contractors, and you certainly belong high up on that list. Thanks again for a job well done.</p>

								<span>- Paul Bachman</span>

							<li><p>We are delighted with the patio - it looks terrific. We are looking forward to enjoying out new patio in Spring. We enjoyed watching the process of this being completed, and were very impressed with you and your assistants and how well everything was kept cleaned and picked up. Thank you again for the great experience. We will gladly recommend you to others, and if we find ourselves with another concrete project, we will definitely be calling you again.</p>

								<span>- Katie DeMarco</span>

							<li><p>Lowell, thank you and your team, we love the way out patio looks. Please feel free to use us as a reference or take pictures for your overflowing book.</p>

							<li><p>I hired Lowell Russell to pour the floors of my home with 4,000 square foot footprint, and I would hire him again. He is a master and it shows. Additionally, his prices were fair, he did what he said he would do, and kept me informed every step of the way. </p>

								<span>- Pete Bissonette</span>

							<li><p>The patios are beautiful. Thanks to you and your work crews for a job well done. We appreciated the beauty of your work. We will definitely recommend your work to others.</p>
