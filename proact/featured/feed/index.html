										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Coal Tar was discovered on a major construction site outside of Denver, ProAct was chosen because of our expertise in dewatering and removing the contamination.<span id="more-216"></span>When Coal Tar was discovered on a major construction site outside of Denver, ProAct was chosen because of our expertise in dewatering and removing the contamination.<br />
After the project, Ian Mestdagh, VP of Operations at ESA, had this to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>“There is always a concern when dewatering a project, especially with high levels of contamination.<br />
We took a conservative approach at Confluence Park with three water treatment trailers on-site at one point, running an elaborate dewatering and contamination removal system.<br />
Discharging water is a sensitive issue because no one wants to take on the responsibility of possibly discharging contaminants back into the river, which is why we put together a top notch team lead by ProAct Services and worked closely with regulators to stay ahead of any complications.”</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>Ian Mestdagh, VP of Operations at ESA</strong></p>
